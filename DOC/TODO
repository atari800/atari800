Plans for future versions
=========================

High-priority items start with '*', low-priority items start with '-'.


Keyboard and joysticks
----------------------

* map host joysticks to Atari ports in the emulation core in order to make
  the configuration available in UI and config file

* pass the state of all host keys to the emulation core in order to configure
  keysticks in UI and config file

* standardize key mappings in all ports (making host and Atari layouts
  available everywhere)

* emulate POKEY keyboard scanning (with optional debouncing)

- Atari Keyboard Interface (AKI)


Emulation core
--------------

* cycle-exact POKEY interrupts (timers, serial I/O, keyboard)

* precisely emulate serial I/O rates

* emulate POKEY reset (via SKCTL)

* more accurate frame rates (for example 49.8607456 instead of 50 Hz in PAL)

- copy-protected disk images (VAPI, ATP, PRO, copy-protected ATR)

* emulate POKEY SIO shift register

- emulate SIO bus lines, and SIO cable data/audio cross-talk "feep" sound

- emulate 1200XL (two programmable LEDs)

- emulate XEGS (built-in cartridge and detachable keyboard)

- Axlon memory expansions

- redirection of specific Dn: devices to Hn: (for software that insists
  on using the D: device)

- log POKEY audio writes, SIO commands (hardware level or DCB level),
  executed DL commands, all activity to a defined range of adressess etc.
  in a way similar to the 6502 trace

- log events that affect software compatibility: undocumented 6502 opcodes,
  unofficial system calls (incl. 5200), extended memory access

- emulate drives at the hardware level (810, 1050, XF551.) use code from other
  emulators which does this.  (drive rotation, FM/MFM raw bits).  WDCxxxx
  controller.  RIOT chip.  6507.  Intel 8048-line chip for the XFD551.
  Use emulated SIO line for bit-banging.  Emulate Drive upgrades (Happy etc.)
  Emulate 3rd party drives (Rana etc.)

- sound effects.  Drive retracking noise (BlueMSX has.)  Motor whine.
  On/off switch sound.  Physical key-press sounds.  Cartridge slot sounds.
  Drive door sounds. Floppy rotation flap sound.

- Atari vapourware emulation. 1400XL. 1450XLD. XEM (see below). 1090.
  1060 CP/M (sweet-pea.)

- emulate the 850 interface at the hardware level.

- ATR-8000 emulation.  ATR-8500.  Need schematics, ROM images, and Disk images.
  Adapt an existing CPM emulator.

- emulate the 800-only FULL-VIEW 80 BOARD by Bit3 Computer Corp and
  Austin-Franklin 80-Column Board.  Need ROM images and schematics.

* 6502 BRK bug

* try to understand 6502's "unstable" opcodes (0x93, 0x9b, 0x9f) that seem
  to have unpredictable (at least not easily predictable) results,
  preferrably by studying 6502 schematics

* an option to emulate the variant of 6502 used in new XE machines
  (which lacks most of the undocumented opcodes of the classic 6502)

* fully emulate executing 6502 code from Hardware, cycle-exact ANTIC_load
  from hardware, cycle-exact PMG flickering bus data

- CPU upgrades (65816, etc)

- emulate printer graphics (on screen or bitmap/PDF output): 1029, 1020, etc.
  The Mac OS X port of Atari800 has lots of printer emulation routines.

* RAM Carts (cartridges with battery-powered RAM), writes to flash carts

- serial "network" interfaces (e.g. 8 Ataris connected, is it GameLink?)

- generate hard disk images or write directly to media that the 8-bit Ataris
  can use, like CompactFlash or MyIDE/SmartIDE/BB

- "Turbo" cassette upgrades (Turbo 2000 etc.)

- cassette emulation of WAV files.  Load a WAV file like WAV2CAS does. Save
  to a WAV file or real cassette like CAS2WAV does.  Load voice-and-data
  combined programmed audio tape images from WAV files.  Support compressed
  (lossless? lossy even?) tape sound images.

- disk auto-flip.  Examine screen data for text string "Insert Side B
  and press any key/fire/return." Flip disk, print on-screen message and
  optionally press key. More a core feature than UI. Requires a database.

- support physical floppy media (hard, port-specific and not very useful)

- support physical Atari drives (hard, port-specific and not very useful)

- event history. Record a keypress/joystick event history.  Need a file format
  that is good (compress?) Don't use cycle-exact RANDOM since that could
  change easily in future versions.  Use our own rand() (with option to use
  true RANDOM. Provide all features that VICE has. Optionally calculate and
  store CRC-32 for each screen of pixels.  Verify playback in future revisions
  of the emulator.  A very good regression test.  Have volunteers make
  recordings.
  There could be walk-throughs, high score contests like MAME Action Replay.
  perry: I have code to do a basic recording and CRC-32 but I need a
  good file format.


Graphics
--------

* better color palettes

* use different palettes for PAL and NTSC modes (and GTIA vs CTIA?)

* "flicker fixer": display average pixel values of two last Atari frames

- XEP80 emulation. Slor is working on it, contact him first.

* use YUV output if available. Will it help?

* PAL emulation. VICE has it, but it's not as complete as Blargg's emulation
  of NTSC. PAL luma/chroma artifacts are missing (it is like S-Video).
  Blargg's optimization technique won't work so easily for PAL.
  (perry: I have a hack of Blargg's slow version of the NTSC emulator that
  I tried to make work for PAL.  But it isn't quite right and is way too slow.
  Ask me if you are interested.)

* the NTSC emulator should support either 16 or 32 bpp and should support
  other resolutions. It should be supported in all possible ports.

* fix the remaining bugs in the NTSC emulation.  Artificating colours are
  not quite right.  odd-even and even-odd combined artifacts (light red
  and light green) do not show unless Gaussian factor is changed a lot,
  which causes even worse artifacts.  Fully document the Atari's video
  output signal (might require a scope.)  Fully document NTSC decoding
  of late 70's and 80's era TVs.

* document CTIA and emulate properly.  Emulate the players not aligning
  with playfield bug/feature of CTIA which is said to exist. Need
  at least screenshots of a CTIA Atari showing all possible artifacts.

* an option to emulate the buggy GTIA chip found in new XE machines.

* fix all remaining collision bugs in the ANTIC and GTIA code (border+scroll,
  player HPOS and GRAF changes, partial_scanline changes.) Use the technique
  of saving data that might generate false collisions, drawing, and then
  restoring the data (pm_scanline).

* cycle-exact DMACTL and HSCROL including all glitches


Sound
-----

* get rid of VOL_ONLY_SOUND

* correctly emulate serial I/O sound

* merge POKEY sound engines

* POKEY sound should NOT be asynchronous to the rest of the emulation
  (for example, the contents of the generated WAVs should not depend
  on the speed of the emulation)

* include sound settings in the emulation core (command line options,
  config file, UI) and make it possible to change them at runtime

* support WAV files in configurations with no live sound

- an option to auto-enable stereo when an Atari program uses it

* Covox

- 2 POKEY mono, 4 POKEY stereo, 4 POKEY quad

- MIDI <> serial port interface.  In it's simplest form there's only MIDI
  output from the Atari.  The more complicated version is enabled by the motor
  control line and includes two MIDI outputs selected by the command control
  line and one MIDI input.  There is a MIDI composer program for Atari.

- A/D Converter - 4-bit sampler that returns 0xf0-0xff in the 0xd500-0xd5ff
  address space.

- XEM AMY-1 Chip.  This is a huge project.  Schematics (netlist)
  are said to exist. Prototyping software for the PC (connected to parallel
  port) is available online. Datasheet is online. Need netlist for AMY-1,
  schematics for XEM and any software.

- SID chip


User Interface
--------------

* if UI fileselector cannot open a folder either user should be alerted
  or the fileselector should open another folder and not sit there quietly
  like if it was ignoring the user completely

* make sure all command-line options are available in UI and config file

* error messages should appear on screen and not in the log

- use a smaller font for low-resolution displays

- on screen display, like a TV remote, for the NTSC (or other) screen filter.

- a database to identify programs and choose appropriate settings.
  OS version.  Memory size.  Memory expansion type.  Peripherals.
  Machine type.  Joystick/Trackball/Paddle etc. controller type.
  Artifacting mode.  SIO patch compatibility. Even if compatible with
  SIO patch, loading screen graphics are often interesting to watch, so
  give the user an option to view or ignore them if present. If not
  SIO patch compatible, optional warp-speed through the loading.
  Keyboard layout. Advisories as to bad dump/bad image/special considerations
  Provide documentation, box scan, label scan for the program
  PAL/NTSC mode. Database should indicate PAL/NTSC
  compatibility, and which system the program was originally designed for.
  Allow PAL users to prefer PAL for NTSC-designed programs, but NTSC users
  to prefer NTSC.  NTSC users get PAL (or fake NTSC-upgraded-to-PAL) for
  all PAL-designed programs (Except perhaps very old ones like English
  Software titles that NTSC users might remember.) PAL users get NTSC
  video only for artifacting programs.


Clean up
--------

* clean up the "util" directory - remove obsolete files, write one-file
  documentation for all utils

* make documentation consistent across systems, maybe using templates

* further clean up in the directory structure - port specific files should
  be hidden in their subfolders (falcon, amiga, ...)


Speed optimizations
-------------------

* use a boolean variable to disable 6502 history tracking and breakpoints
  (even with MONITOR_BREAKPOINTS and MONITOR_TRACE it should be
  faster than currently with just the default MONITOR_BREAK)

* use function pointer table for hardware registers (like PAGED_ATTRIB does)

* optimize the new POKEY sound engine

* emulate 6502 during vertical blank in a single GO() call

* prefer int to UWORD and UBYTE (especially in cpu.c)

* try merging N and Z flags into one variable

- use patches for common routines such as OS interrupt handlers

- make some hardware registers directly available in memory[]

* write versions of draw_antic_* functions for the common case when there are
  no sprites in the current scanline

* update color lookup tables only when color registers change

* put 6502 flags into local variables so they can be put in registers

* automatic framedrop

- generate 168x120 graphics for portable devices with low-res displays

- boost memory bank switching by using hardware paging on systems
  that support it (for example, use mmap() on Linux)

- boost memory bank switching by using Get/Put functions for the banked memory,
  PC_PTR and some tweaks in antic.c

- implement Dirty Spans (see HOWTO-DIRTYSPAN)

- think about using MMX and SSE (for display and sound probably)

- think about optimizations for the more and more common 64-bit and multi-core
  CPUs so we can reach 256 times Atari speed sooner ;-)

- an option to detect popular lengthy Atari decompression routines
  and run equivalent C routines instead


R: device
---------

- clean up and comment the code

- improve portability

- documentation

- automatic test (similar to hdevtest.lst for H:)

- identify security problems

- TCP port should be configurable (currently hardwired to 9000). The switch
  between real serial port and TCP port should be put there. Something
  along the following lines:
  R_SERIAL = 1
  R_SERPORT = /dev/ttyS0
  R_NETPORT = 9000
