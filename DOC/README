This is the emulator of Atari 8-bit computer systems and the 5200 console
for Unix, Linux, Amiga, MS-DOS, Atari TT/Falcon, MS Windows, MS WinCE,
Sega Dreamcast, Android and systems running the SDL library.
Our main objective is to create a freely distributable portable emulator
(i.e. with source code available).
It can be configured to run in the following ways :-

	1. "simple" version (many platforms) - uses only the standard C library
	2. curses (many platforms)
	3. X Window + Optional XVIEW or MOTIF User Interface
	4. CBM Amiga
 	5. MS-DOS (DJGPP)
	6. Atari Falcon/TT and compatible machines
	7. MS Windows (DirectX)
	8. SDL (running on _many_ platforms)
	9. WinCE
	10. Sega Dreamcast
	11. JVM (Java applet)
	12. Android
	13. Raspberry Pi
	14. libatari800 (platform independent) - the emulator core as a library

The "simple" version is only useful for running programs such as MAC65,
Atari BASIC etc. I have had this version running on Linux,
SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.4, Silicon Graphics, VAX/VMS, CBM Amiga
(Dice C and GNU C), DOS/DJGPP and the HP-UX 9000/380.

When using curses, the emulator is similar to the "simple" version, but it
also enables full screen editing capability. Some computer don't seem to
support curses fully - SunOS 4.1.3, VAX/VMS, LINUX (but ncurses is OK).

The X Window version supports graphics and has an optional XVIEW
or MOTIF user interface. The Linux X Window version can be built with
joystick and mouse support.

The Amiga version supports graphics but currently lacks Paddle support.

The MS-DOS version supports 320x200, 320x240 and even 320x480 interlaced
graphics, sound (SoundBlaster compatible sound cards, 8bit),
keyboard, one joystick connected to game port and up to three additional
digital joysticks connected to parallel (printer) ports and mouse.

The Atari Falcon030/040 version supports 320x240 and 336x240 Falcon/TT
8-bit planes graphics modes, NOVA graphics cards, DMA sound and both
joysticks (old CX-40, Atari800 compatible - not the new paddle-like ones).

The SDL version should compile on Unix, Win32, BeOS, etc... It's optimized for
8, 16 and 32 color depth. Of course it will work fastest in 8bit. If you use it
in XFree86 - please set "Depth=8" in XF86Config to gain maximum speed.
Includes support for joystick and mouse.

All versions supporting bitmapped graphics have a User Interface implemented
on the emulator's "screen". The User Interface is enter by pressing F1 at any
time. ESC is used to return to the previous screen.

The libatari800 target is designed for embedding in other programs, depends on
no external libraries, and has no user interface. It allows the user to
calculate successive video frames of emulation, and instead of displaying
anything by itself, it provides the ability to access the raw graphics screen
and main memory that the user can process as desired.
