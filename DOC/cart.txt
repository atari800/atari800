This file describes types of cartridge images supported by the Atari800
emulator.

There are:
- raw images - files that contain only dump of cartridge memory
- CART files - images with additional 16-byte header, which contains type
  of the cartridge

For raw images you usually have to select the cartridge type each time
you insert an image. To make it easier, you only select from types of same
image size. If there's only one supported type that matches file's length
(currently only for 2 KB cartridges), that type is selected automatically.

The advantage of using CART files is that you don't have to select
the cartridge type, because it is stored inside the file.

The CART format has been introduced in Atari800 0.8.0, when there were
only 4 supported cartridge types. The format has not changed, only new types
have been added.

The format is:
 first 4 bytes containing 'C' 'A' 'R' 'T'.
 next 4 bytes containing cartridge type in MSB format (see the table below).
 next 4 bytes containing cartridge checksum in MSB format (ROM only).
 next 4 bytes are currently unused (zero).
 followed immediately with the ROM data: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 40, etc. kilobytes.

The recommended file name extension for CART files is CAR.

Currently supported cartridge types:

+----+-----------+------+-----------------------------------------------+---+

Id is the cartridge type code stored in the CART file.

Machine indicates if the cartridge is for Atari 8-bit Home Computers
(400/800 and XL/XE) or the Atari 5200 Game System.

Size is length of image in kilobytes, unless the value ends with "M", which
means it is in megabytes.

E (for Emulation) describes state of emulation support of the cartridge in
Atari800. "p" means the cartridge is emulated partially (some features
missing), no value means emulation of all features.

Below are descriptions of all types. For bank-switched cartridges banks
are numbered in the order they appear in the image file, starting with 0.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 1: Standard 8 KB cartridge                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 8 KB cartridge, that occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000
 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 2: Standard 16 KB cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 16 KB cartridge, that occupies 16 KB of address space between
 $8000 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 3: OSS two chip 16 KB cartridge (034M)                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 NOTE: This cartridge image format has been obsoleted by Type 45 because its
 order of banks is incorrect (i.e. the order in a physical cartridge's ROM
 chips is different). This format is still supported by the CART file format
 for backward compatibility.

 The cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. Its
 memory is divided into 4 banks, 4 KB each. Bank number 3 (the last one) is
 always mapped to $B000-$BFFF. Bank in $A000-$AFFF is selected by an access to
 $D500-$D5FF. Only 4 lowest bits of address are significant:
 - $D5x0 selects bank 0.
 - $D5x1 is not useful - it selects banks 0 and 1 (the bytes are binary AND of
   the corresponding bytes from banks 0 and 1).
 - $D5x3 or $D5x7 selects bank 1.
 - $D5x4 selects bank 2.
 - $D5x5 is not useful - it selects banks 1 and 2 (the bytes are binary AND of
   the corresponding bytes from banks 1 and 2).
 - $D5x2 or $D5x6 is not useful. It disables ROM (there are $FF bytes in
   $A000-$AFFF).
 - $D5x8-$D5xF disables whole cartridge (enables computer's memory in address
   space between $A000 and $BFFF).

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 4: Standard 32 KB 5200 cartridge                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 32 KB cartridge for Atari 5200, that occupies 32 KB of address
 space between $4000 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 5: DB 32 KB cartridge                                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 A 32 KB bank-switched cartridge. There are 4 banks. Bank 3 is mapped to
 $A000-$BFFF. Bank in $8000-$9FFF is selected by an access to $D500-$D5FF.
 Two lowest bits of address select bank 0, 1, 2 or 3.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 6: Two chip 16 KB 5200 cartridge                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 In Atari 5200 there's 32 KB of address space reserved for the cartridge
 ($4000-$BFFF). A two chip 16 KB cartridge is mapped that way:
 - First 8 KB are mapped into lower 16 KB. Since an address line is not
   connected, $4000-$5FFF and $6000-$7FFF contain same data, which is first
   half of the cartridge image.
 - Similarly, second 8 KB are mapped into upper 16 KB.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 7: Bounty Bob Strikes Back 40 KB 5200 cartridge                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge with "Bounty Bob Strikes Back" game uses very strange
 bank switching method:
 - Four 4 KB banks (0,1,2,3) are mapped into $4000-$4FFF. An access to $4FF6
   selects bank 0, $4FF7 - bank 1, $4FF8 - bank 2, $4FF9 - bank 3.
 - Four 4 KB banks (4,5,6,7) are mapped into $5000-$5FFF. An access to $5FF6
   selects bank 4, $5FF7 - bank 5, $5FF8 - bank 6, $5FF9 - bank 7.
 - The remaining 8 KB is mapped to upper 16 KB of cartridge address space
   in Atari 5200. That is, $8000-$9FFF and $A000-$BFFF contain same data.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 8: 64 KB Williams cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D500 selects
 bank 0, $D501 - bank 1, etc. An access to $D508-$D50F disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 9: Express 64 KB cartridge                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D577 selects
 bank 0, $D576 - bank 1, etc. An access to $D578-$D57F disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 10: Diamond 64 KB cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D5D7 selects
 bank 0, $D5D6 - bank 1, etc. An access to $D5D8-$D5DF disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 11: SpartaDOS X 64 KB cartridge                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. It also contains an
 additional cartridge slot which allows to plug a second cartridge in.
 An access to $D5E7 selects bank 0, $D5E6 - bank 1, etc. down to $D5E0. An
 access to $D5E8-$D5EB disables the SDX cartridge and enables the second
 cartridge. An access to $D5EC-$D5EF disables both cartridges.
 Accesses to all addresses on page D5 always reaches the second cartridge,
 even if it is disabled by SpartaDOS or if the SpartaDOS cartridge itself is
 enabled.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 12: XEGS 32 KB cartridge                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 4 banks, 8 KB each.
 Bank 3 (the last one) is always mapped to $A000-$BFFF. Two lowest bits of
 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$9FFF.
 The initially selected bank is random, although it seems that 0 gets chosen
 the most often. Atari800 always selects bank 0 initially.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 13: XEGS 64 KB cartridge (banks 0-7)                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 One of the two variants of the 64 KB XEGS cartridge, that's built on either
 a C100649 board with the W1 solder point not connected, or a C026449 board
 with pin 9 of the 74LS374 chip unconnected.
 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 8 banks, 8 KB each.
 Bank 7 (the last one) is always mapped to $A000-$BFFF. Three lowest bits of
 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$9FFF.
 The initially selected bank is random, although it seems that 0 gets chosen
 the most often. Atari800 always selects bank 0 initially.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 14: XEGS 128 KB cartridge                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Built on either a C100649 board with the W1 solder point connected, or a
 C026449 board.
 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 16 banks, 8 KB each.
 Bank 15 (the last one) is always mapped to $A000-$BFFF. Four lowest bits of
 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$9FFF.
 The initially selected bank is random, although it seems that 0 gets chosen
 the most often. Atari800 always selects bank 0 initially.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 15: OSS one chip 16 KB cartridge                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 There are two types of OSS 16KB cartridges; this is the later, simpler one.
 Used by BASIC XL 1.03, Action! 3.6, MAC/65 1.1 and BASIC XE 4.1 (and possibly
 also by later versions of the above software).
 It consists of one 16 KB ROM chip.
 The cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. Its
 memory is divided into 4 banks, 4 KB each. Bank number 0 (the first one) is
 always mapped to $B000-$BFFF. Bank in $A000-$AFFF is selected by an access to
 $D500-$D5FF. Only bits 0 and 3 of address are significant:
 - A3=0, A0=0 - selects bank 1
 - A3=0, A0=1 - selects bank 3
 - A3=1, A0=0 - disables cartridge (enables computer's memory in address space
   between $A000 and $BFFF)
 - A3=1, A0=1 - selects bank 2

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 16: One chip 16 KB 5200 cartridge                                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 16 KB cartridge for Atari 5200, that occupies 16 KB of address space
 between $8000 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 17: Decoded Atrax 128 KB cartridge                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The Atrax cartridge has its address and data lines intermixed as a kind of
 copy protection - dumping a ROM chip directly would result in a dump that
 would need decoding before reading data. This cartridge type represents
 a decoded ROM dump, for example as a result of dumping by reading the
 cartridge using an Atari computer. The original, non-decoded dump is
 represented by Type 68: Atrax 128 KB cartridge.

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 16 banks, 8 KB each.
 If a byte written to $D500-$D5FF has highest bit set, the cartridge is
 disabled. Otherwise four lowest bits select the bank mapped to $A000-$BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 18: Bounty Bob Strikes Back 40 KB cartridge                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge with "Bounty Bob Strikes Back" game uses very strange
 bank switching method:
 - Four 4 KB banks (0,1,2,3) are mapped into $8000-$8FFF. An access to $8FF6

 Used in The Writer's Tool cartridge, it is actually an OSS one chip cartridge
 board (see Type 15) with an 8 KB ROM chip instead of a normal 16 KB one.
 The cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. Its
 memory is divided into 2 banks, 4 KB each. Bank number 0 (the first one) is
 always mapped to $B000-$BFFF. Bank in $A000-$AFFF is selected by an access to
 $D500-$D5FF. Only bits 0 and 3 of address are significant:
 - A3=0, A0=0 or 1 - selects bank 1
 - A3=1, A0=0 - disables cartridge (enables computer's memory in address space
   between $A000 and $BFFF)
 - A3=1, A0=1 - selects bank 0

 complicated one. Used by BASIC XL 1.02 and earlier, Action! 3.5 and earlier,
 and MAC/65 1.0. It consists of two 8 KB ROM chips.
 The cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. Its
 memory is divided into 4 banks, 4 KB each. Bank number 3 (the last one) is
 always mapped to $B000-$BFFF. Bank in $A000-$AFFF is selected by an access to
 $D500-$D5FF. Only 4 lowest bits of address are significant:
 - $D5x0 selects bank 0.
 - $D5x1 is not useful - it selects banks 0 and 2 (the bytes are binary AND of
   the corresponding bytes from banks 0 and 2).
 - $D5x3 or $D5x7 selects bank 2.
 - $D5x4 selects bank 1.
 - $D5x5 is not useful - it selects banks 1 and 2 (the bytes are binary AND of
   the corresponding bytes from banks 1 and 2).
 - $D5x2 or $D5x6 is not useful. It disables ROM (there are $FF bytes in
   $A000-$AFFF).
 - $D5x8-$D5xF disables whole cartridge (enables computer's memory in address
   space between $A000 and $BFFF).

 This cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. The
 cartridge memory is divided into 128 banks, 256 B each. On power on, bank 0
 is visible in $A000-$BFFF (repeated 32 times) and also in $D500-$D5FF. A
 write operation to $D500-$D5FF disables the cartridge (freeing the
 $A000-$BFFF area) and selects the next 256-byte bank visible at $D500-$D5FF.
 After bank 31 the write operation selects bank 0 again.

 two 8KB subbanks. Each subbank can be mapped to Atari memory or switched
 off. The lower subbank always maps to $8000-$9FFF, while the upper one always
 maps to $A000-$BFFF.
 Control register address is $D500-$D51F mirrored, read/write (written value
 can be read at any time).
 Bit 7 = 0 - flash write-protection is on
 Bit 6 = 0 - odd 8k block (upper subbank) present in $A000-$BFFF
 Bit 5 = 0 - even 8k block (lower subbank) not present in $8000-$9FFF 
 Bits 4..3 - unused
 Bits 2..0 - 16KB bank number (0..7)
 Default value = 0 which means 0 bank upper subbank in address $A000-$BFFF
 To switch cart off - poke $40 info $D500-$D51F
 The cartridge also supports programming of the Flash ROM - this feature is
 currently not emulated.

| Type 61: MegaMax 2 MB cartridge                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 A variant of the MegaMax cartridge with 2MB ROM. The cartridge has a switch
 to toggle between the 1 MB Atarimax-compatible mode and the 2MB mode;
 this type describes the latter one.

 A bank-switched cartridge that occupies 16 KB of address space between
 $8000 and $BFFF. It is controlled by access to an address at $D500-$D5FF.
 Bits 0-6 of the address select one of 128 available banks, bit 7 disables the
 cartridge. The cartridge starts with bank 0 enabled.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Only a small subset, as described below, of this cartridge's features is
 currently emulated.

 The cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF, and
 consists of 16384 banks. Byte written to $D5A2 turns the cartridge on/off:
 bit 0 = 1 enables the cartridge, 0 disables it and enables RAM. The enabled
 bank is controlled by bytes written to $D5A0 (LSB) and $D5A1 (MSB, only 6
 lowest bytes matter). Any write do $D5A0-$D5A1 also automatically enables the
 cartridge.

 The cartridge starts with bank 0 enabled.

 The $D5A0-$D5A2 registers are read/write; one can read the cartridge's current
 state from them. Unused bits are always read as 0.

| Type 63: Flash MegaCart 4 MB cartridge                                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 A bank-switched cartridge that occupies 16 KB of address space between
 $8000 and $BFFF. It is controlled by a byte written to $D500-$D51F. Values
 0-254 select one of the first 255 banks, and the value 255 disables the
 cartridge. Bank 255 is not available. The cartridge starts with bank 254
 enabled.

 A read from $D500-$D51F returns the last value written (initially 254).
 
 The cartridge also has ROM flashing functionality, which is currently not
 emulated.

| Type 67: XEGS 64 KB cartridge (banks 8-15)                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 One of the two variants of the 64 KB XEGS cartridge, built on a C026449 board
 with all pins of the 74LS374 chip connected. All software designed for this
 cartridge type also works with the other variant; see Type 13.
 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 8 banks, 8 KB each.
 Bank 7 (the last one) is always mapped to $A000-$BFFF. Four lowest bits of
 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$9FFF.
 Unsetting bit 3 unmaps the $8000-$9FFFF area and leaves it unconnected
 (floating or all $FFs); otherwise a bank selected by the three lowest bits is
 mapped.
 The initially selected bank is random, although it seems that the value of 0
 (ie. no bank mapped) gets chosen the most often. Atari800 always selects 0
 initially.

    D4 -  Q0
    D5 -  Q1
    D6 -  Q7
    D7 -  Q3
 This cartridge type represents an original, non-decoded ROM dump, as read
 directly from the ROM chip. A decoded ROM dump is represented by Type 17:
 Decoded Atrax 128 KB cartridge.

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 16 banks, 8 KB each.
 If a byte written to $D500-$D5FF has highest bit set, the cartridge is
 disabled. Otherwise four lowest bits select the bank mapped to $A000-$BFFF.

 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 A bank-switched cartridge built on a board marked "A-NA0002". Two variants of
 this board are known: one that connects the EPROM's pin 1 to +5V, and another
 that connects it to an 74169 counter. The cartridge houses a 256 kbit EPROM.
 (The former board variant can also contain a 512 kbit EPROM, but the board is
 hardwired to access only the upper half of the ROM.)

 The cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. Its
 memory is divided into 4 banks, 8 KB each. On power on, bank 0 is visible. Each
 access to $D500-$D5FF increases the visible bank number, looping to 0 after the
 last bank.
