Changes in pre1.0.7
----------------
o introduced autoconf stuff <Krzysztof>
o win32: standard wave output routines added to sound driver (-wavonly switch
  to disable direct sound) <Krzysztof>
o sound_update removed from port specific routines (moved to atari.c) and
  some other sound fixes <Krzysztof>
  
o unix, windows and dos makefiles rewritten and reorganized <Krzysztof>

o all open() calls on regular files replaced by fopen(). <Krzysztof>

o win32 conditionals removed; new win32 port <Krzysztof>

o atari_sleep_ms() replaced by new function atari_sync() with better
  synchronization code (lasttime is increased by constant interval
  and previously could differ depending on gettime call delay) <Krzysztof>

o bug causing vesa modes not to be detected correctly fixed. <Krzysztof>

o cpu_m68k.s is 100% compatible with the cpu.c now <Gerhard>

o Don Mahurin added sound support to curses version.
  Also Voxware_ routines were renamed.

o it seems that zero in first byte of block 41/C1 should be interpreted
   as 00, not 0x100 [eg. 1st disk of Big Demo couldn't be read because of
   this]. Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@prioris.mini.pw.edu.pl>

o double density DCM disks weren't handled properly ("Output
  desynchronized...") [eg. 1st disk of Sweet Illusions demo couldn't be
  read because of this] <Jakub>

o some preliminary code for UI menu switch for readonly/readwrite disk
  in UI.C. This needs to be discussed first, then finished.



Changes in 1.0.6  - 2000/10/09
----------------

o cpu_m68k.s updated <Gerhard>

- the rest is Piotr's work:

o BUGS updated

o antic: fixed PMG collisions bug in horizontally scrolled lines
  (bug was found by Krzysztof)

o antic: PMG flickering depends on VDELAY setting

o makefile.dos: in 1.0.4 BASIC and PDCURSES weren't compilable,
  because of pokeysnd call, while pokeysnd wasn't linked - fixed

o antic,gtia: few warnings killed

o devices: -H1..-H4 options work correctly now

o E_Device, K_Device and AtariEscape moved from atari.c to devices.c

o E_Device and K_Device ESC codes work only in BASIC version now

o sio: debug code removed

o devices, rt-config: H: devices can be set to read-only mode:
  use -hdreadonly option or HD_READ_ONLY config file item
  (0 disables, 1 enables read-only mode). For safety, by default
  it is on

o BASIC version: EOF in stdin quits emulator. BASIC version can be used now
  with redirected input (from a script file, for example).


Changes in 1.0.5  - 2000/10/02
----------------

o possibility to set color saturation
  Now you can set black level, white level, color intensity and even color
  shift if you prefer artificial palettes.
  Added config option allows to select whether include existing palettes
  into binary. By default artificial palette is generated (by surprise it
  doesn't look very bad)
  New options are:
  -black  <black level>
  -white  <white level>
  -colors  <color intensity>
  -colshift  <color shift>
  -realpal <use real palette>
  -oldpal <use old default palette>
  -foxpal <use Fox's palette>

  Krzysztof

o sound.c got -help <Krzysztof>

o bug causing vesa modes not to be detected correctly fixed. <Krzysztof>

o sound_dos.c compiler warnings fixed

o ui.c - reading of root dirs corrected <Krzysztof>

o pokey.c - better reading of saved pokey state <Krzysztof>

o statesav.c - strict version check and version increased to 3 <Krzysztof>

o binload.c - C flag and boot flag are set now (some programs need it)
  <Krzysztof>

o joystick autofire emulation (dos and svgalib only). F11 key switches
  between three modes: normal, autofire when fire pressed and autofire
  all the time. It can be quite useful for some games >:) <Krzysztof>

o gtia.c fix - pm_scanline was too short when HSCROL was used.
  'mountain king' game suffered from this bug. <Krzysztof>

o atari_x11.c - small fix for keyrepeat (fvwm2, switching back to the
  screen 2 FocusIn requests are generated). <Christian Groessler>

o DOS SoundBlaster driver updated. <Matt>
  The new SB code is very clean, and should fix the problem that one person
  had with no sound being generated.

  If  Atari800 enables near pointers (via __djgpp_enable_nearptr()), you may
  want to define DJGPP_USE_NEARPTR; it will make the SB driver a bit faster,
  as it can avoid an extra buffer copy to the low DOS area.

o vga_asm.s patched to quell a compiler warning. <Matt>

o sio.c - new routine to rotate disks and slight parameter change in SIO_Mount
  that allows a disk to be opened read only even if it is a read/write image.
  <Rich>

o sndsave.[ch] (new module) - writes out .WAV files of arbitrary bitrate.
  <Rich>

o linux joystick patch - both keyboard emulation and real joystick can be used
  for multiplayer games now. <Jacek>


Changes in 1.0.4  - 2000/06/30
----------------

o Amiga version updated <Sebastian>

o CRASH menu fixed <Raster>

--Piotr's changes:

o UI: added artifacting mode selection

o DOS/VGA sources moved to 'dos' subdirectory, Makefile.dos and atari_vga.c
  updated

o DOS/VGA: F8 disabled in UI

o DOS/VGA: mouse initialized after return from monitor, right button enables
  light pen cursor

o gtia: TRIG latches (enabled by bit 2 of GRACTL) implemented

o antic: light pen emulation improved

o antic: GTIA modes implemented for ANTIC modes 9, 0xb and 0xc

o atari_screen moved from antic.[ch] to atari.[ch]

o old BIN loader removed

o obsolete NAS support removed; Atari_AUDC/AUDF/AUDCTL routines removed - now
  pokey.c directly calls pokeysnd.c


Changes in 1.0.3  - 2000/06/13
----------------

o SVGALIB and Falcon ports save interlaced and non-interlaced screenshots
  by pressing Shift+F10/F10 (this is just to sync it with DOS version)

-- Piotr:
o new BIN loader rewritten - hopefully it can load any valid executable.
  Please test if there's a file, which it can't run.

o special support for Montezuma's Revenge removed - it's not needed
  for playing this game

o UI:
- fixed 'Cold Start' item - name was too long
- fixed background width - was too wide
- charset extracted from 5200's ROM - menu is visible in 5200 mode
- whenever prompted for filename, you can cancel with ESC
- added 'Enter monitor' item
- added PCX screenshots with user-specified filename
  (F10 and Shift+F10 still generate it automatically)

-- Raster:
o hot keys in UI aligned right

o when CPU encounters invalid instruction (CIM or unassigned
  ESC) the new Crash menu appears. Now you can select Reset,
  Reboot, go to Menu or Monitor. You can also try to continue
  running the program or exit the emulator.

o CPU.C: CIM instruction emulation doesn't do PC-- so that the
  'continue' function of Crash menu can work


Changes in 1.0.2  - 2000/05/29
----------------

o Matt fixed his DOS SB driver

-- Piotr's changes:
o gray.act palette

o DOS/VGA: assembly part of x_open moved to vga_asm.s as x_open_asm
  - this should make new djgpp happy :)

o cpu: opcodes $8b and $ab restored - they work different on Atari
  than on C64

o monitor: READ and WRITE don't quit emulator on error

o monitor: S can search for any number of bytes

o monitor: HELP corrected - [] used for optional parameters only


Changes in 1.0.1  - 2000/05/25
----------------

o ANTIC&GTIA: another PMG speed optimization <Piotr>

o cpu_m68k.s: updated to reflect recent Piotr's changes <Gerhard>

o CPU: 6 undocumented instructions fixed  <Matt>


Changes in 1.0.0  - 2000/05/22
----------------

o Atari Falcon
- makes use of draw_display which greatly improves playability
  (on my Falcon040/40MHz most games run at 100% of original speed with
   -refresh=5)
- Sound_Pause/Continue implemented (no more sound in menu).
- UI hotkeys implemented (try out Alt+A, for example)

o UI: hotkeys are listed so everybody can learn them easily

o new sound card driver for DOS version from Matt Conte <matt@conte.com>
  This allows us to increase replay freq and also implement STEREO sound in DOS
  Try out command line parameters "-dsprate 44100" and maybe also "-bufsize 880"
  (bufsize is 440 bytes by default which I think is too small for higher replay
  rates) <me>

o fixed some wrong fopen calls - please always use "rt"/"wt" for reading/writting
  text files and similarly "rb"/"wb" for reading/writting binary files.

-- And Piotr's changes follow:

o configure program checks endianess and defines ATARI800_BIG_ENDIAN
  if necessary - POKEYSND_BIG_ENDIAN and ANTIC_BIG_ENDIAN removed

o configure program defines ATARI800_64_BIT if sizeof(long) != 4 - __alpha__
  kludge removed

o added -fomit-frame-pointer to makefile.dos - with this ebp register can hold
  local variables

o assembler routines from DOS/VGA port grouped in vga_asm.s - this fixes
  problems with -fomit-frame-pointer and hopefully with new DJGPP - please
  check

o diskled fixed
- drawn on screen also when sio patch active
- support for modes with less than 240 visible lines
- Atari_Set_LED called only when state changes - this speeds up sio
  and prevents keyboard hang-ups in DOS/VGA with keyboard led

o DOS/VGA: now middle of Atari screen visible in 320x200
  - previously lines 24..223

ANTIC/GTIA fixes:

o PMG flickering corrected again - DL opcode is passed to missiles, lsb of
  address is passed to player 3

o need_load fixed - correct graphics and timing when DMA switched on and off

o colour_translation_table fixed
- now colours in X11/SHM are hopefully correct in all modes except
  artifacting
- colour_translation_table isn't used unless USE_COLOUR_TRANSLATION_TABLE is
  defined (see atari.h)
- if used, colour_translation_table should be UWORD with msb = lsb

o playfield/PMG priorities handling completely rewritten
- now all playfield/PMG/prior combinations are handled correctly
- PMG is slightly faster



Changes in 0.9.9j
-----------------

o Amiga port is compilable (Pen, Sound Start/Stop) <Sebastian>

o Unix port is compilable (Pen, Sound Start/Stop) <cpg>

o Atari Falcon port is not compilable yet! I left the patches at home :-(
  <my fault>

o Makefile.unix: call sub-makes with "$(MAKE)" instead of "make". Helps on
  machines where GNU make is not named "make" <cpg>

o atari.h: set ULONG and SLONG to be unsigned int on Alpha machines,
  as longs there are 8 bytes (64bit). See also TODO file. <cpg>

o pokeysnd.c: fixed unaligned accesses. Tested on Alpha (= little endian) <cpg>

o UI: the order of options changed. <Raster>

o UI: driven by hotkeys diirectly from emulation <Raster>
  Currently DOS and Linux SVGALIB versions only:
  * Hot keys (with left ALT):
  ALT+D	Disk management
  ALT+C	Cartridge management
  ALT+R	Run BIN file
  ALT+Y	Select system
  ALT+O	Sound Mono/Stereo
  ALT+S	Save state
  ALT+L	Load state
  ALT+A	About
  (by pressing ESC you go back to emulation)

  Other platforms: set alt_function (defined in ui.c) to MENU_xxx (see
  atari.h) and call the UI.
  Example for Disk Management:
    alt_function = MENU_DISK;
    keycode = AKEY_UI;

And the usual huge list of changes from Piotr follows
-----------------------------------------------------
o DD XFD images fixed - now both 128- and 256-byte boot sectors supported

o cpu.c can be now compiled for using switch() - cpu_nogoto.c is no longer
  necessary (Petr: use -DNO_GOTO when compiling)

o many 6502's unofficial opcodes fixed

o 'DMACLT' typo in symtable fixed

ANTIC/GTIA fixes:

o collisions in hi-res fixed - now Chicken and Super Bunny work

o horizontal scroll in modes 8 and 9 fixed

o PM5 in GTIA 11 fixed

o mode 2 / GTIA 11 fixed

o mode 2 / GTIA 10 implemented

o PMG flickering made more accurate

o some optimizations in ANTIC - mostly for hi-res modes (drawn with words)
  and for blank lines (drawn with memset, if possible)

o simplified Save/Load State in ANTIC and GTIA (Petr: ==> state files are no
  longer compatible with previous versions (actually the compatibility's been
  broken a few versions ago already))

o artifacting works now on long aligning and big endian machines
  (Petr: seems like big endian machines have to define -DANTIC_BIG_ENDIAN for
   proper compiling).

o DMA for DL fixed

o color table fix:
- now table is defined as global and compiled to separate object, so it exists
  once in executable (previously was static - included by both
  platform-specific stuff and ataripcx)
- '-palette filename' command line option allows loading external palette file.
  Palette should be in '.act' file format, which is supported by Photoshop.
  Format is very simple - 256 times (R,G,B), single byte per component.
  I've implemented this option because I think color table should be fixed.
  At the moment luminaces 14 and 15 are identical and other luminaces
  aren't also linear. I include a palette created by me - fox.act. It has
  linear luminaces, however it is ugly compared to current Atari800 palette
  - default.act. It would be great if someone could create realistic palette,
  best by grabbing graphics from real machine with a video card.

o fixes for BASIC version

o mode f / GTIA 11 colours fixed

o delayed GTIA 11 - colours are propagated to next line. Now
  graphics using dark GTIA 11 lines for colouring gray images is really
  colourful, like on real Atari

o emulation of a GTIA bug. While turning off GTIA mode while displaying
  hi-res mode, GTIA doesn't back to hi-res, but starts generating 4-colour
  graphics. This fixes title screen in 'Studio Dream' demo.


Changes in 0.9.9i
-----------------

o fixed my stupid bug in Stereo sound emulation (thanks Marek)

o SHIFT_KEY exported from atari_x11.c now (thanks Mark Watson for the hint)

o UI: Select System does cancel the selection by Esc correctly now
  (thanks Raster for the hint)

o SIO: result wasn't set in default: (thanks Sebastian)

o Amiga changes by <Sebastian>
  -------------
  atari_amiga.c
    old Joystick code was buggy, it does work now.
    supports the global draw_display variable now.
    about Requester works now.
    general cleanup and some comments in atari_amiga.c

  amiga/support.c
    Added

  amiga/ReadMe
    Added

  amiga/Atari800.guide
     has been rewritten (not really finished yet)

  USAGE
    removed old Amiga descriptions and refered to the
    Atari800.guide file

  sio.c
    removed the #ifndef AMIGA. Only one is still left (devices.c,
    that's because I can't test this).

List of changes from Piotr
--------------------------

o ANTIC: WSYNC fixed - changed xpos < WSYNC_C to xpos <= WSYNC_C :)
  This fixes colours in Pitfall II

o ANTIC: PMG flickering fixed. Data should be taken from data bus,
  not rand(). :) However, it is get now from memory at regPC.

o monitor: COLPM0 typo in symtable[] fixed

o IRQ interrupts fixed:
- are reset by POKEY, not CPU
- real SIO is faster and more accurate
- POKEY counters are more accurate

o diskled: Platform-independent disk LED - drawn on screen.
  Can be disabled with #define NO_LED_ON_SCREEN.

o DOS version:
- 320x240 made default video mode
- keyboard layout PC/Atari can be set at startup with 'KEYBOARD'
  in configuration file or '-keyboard' command line option
- Num Lock LED indicates current keyboard layout and Caps Lock LED - disk LED,
  if it isn't drawn on screen. Scroll Lock still indicates joy-only mode.
- paddles/touch pad emulation is enabled with 'MOUSE PAD' in configuration file
  or '-mouse pad' command line option
  Horizontal position of mouse is paddle 0, vertical is paddle 1,
  buttons left and right are buttons of paddles 0 and 1 respectively.
  Tested in ARKANOID and KABOOM. Should be tested on more programs,
  especially those using touch pad.
- light pen emulation is enabled with 'MOUSE PEN' in configuration file
  or '-mouse pen' command line option
  Mouse emulates position of light pen. Left button is pen's button.
  Right button is unused.
  Tested in Atari BASIC only. Should also work in games using light gun.

Atari_PEN() has to be added to all platforms. Atari_PEN(0) returns
horizontal, Atari_PEN(1) vertical position. If light pen emulation isn't
supported, the function should look like this:

int Atari_PEN(int vertical)
{
	return vertical ? 0xff : 0;
}

o ANTIC: mode 3 can be now artifacted and in GTIA modes 9/11
  (ANTIC mode 2 routines used)

o GTIA: missiles optimized a bit

o Delay before reading sector 2. Now OVERMIND works with both emulated
  and real SIO

o DOS version: sound disabled in UI and monitor

o QUIT works when invalid opcode encountered

o Monitor: you can enter system commands with !cmd, for example !dir


Changes in 0.9.9h
-----------------

o a big bunch of changes from Piotr, completely rewritten Antic emulation,
  changed Antic<->CPU synchronization, improved sound, improved PCX screen
  shots including interlaced screenshots and much more.

  The rewritten Antic will need proper testing. Please do test and report
  problems.

o new binloader improved, sound improved <Marek>

o Amiga updates and general clean up <Sebastian>


Changes in 0.9.9g
-----------------

o STEREO sound support (2 POKEYs) added <Marek>

o if STEREO sound is compiled in you can switch between mono/stereo
  output in the F1 menu.

o new binary loader improved again <Marek>

o curses mode improved (now enables the F1 menu, warm start moved to F8)
  Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de>

o a new BRKHERE command for the monitor - if enabled (BRKHERE on) then
  the emulator invokes the monitor when it encounters a BRK instruction.
  Useful only if you use the BRK insn for debugging your own programs.
  Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de>

o new Amiga updates from Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>
    DEFAULT_CFG_PATH
    To alter the default config path
    (if not defined the orginal path is used)

    SUPPORTS_ATARI_CONFIGINIT
    The port provides a function Atari_ConfigInit() which
    inits the configuration to default values.

    SUPPORTS_ATARI_CONFIGSAVE
    The port provides a function Atari_ConfigSave() to save port
    specific configuration lines in the config file.

    SUPPORTS_ATARI_CONFIGURE
    The port provides a function Atari_Configure() for the lines
    not recognized by RtConfigLoad()

    DONT_USE_RTCONFIGUPDATE
    RtConfigUpdate() is not used and compiled (e.g. the Amiga Port
    provides an own GUI for configuration and so this is not needed
    here)

  A list of bugfixes from Piotr Fusik < pfusik@elka.pw.edu.pl >
  -----------------------------------

* NMIST fixed - antic.c

* invalid color of all multicolor players in same place fixed - antic.c

* blank characters can be inverted - antic.c

* PMG DMA in every scanline - antic.c

* DL can not cross 1k boundary - antic.c

* PENV set to $FF - antic.c

* B flag set on BRK and PHP, reset on NMI and IRQ, can not be changed,
  BRK doesn't care about I flag - cpu.c, monitor.c

* TRIG2=1 on XL/XE, PAL=1 on PAL machine - gtia.c

* typos in symtable fixed - monitor.c

* 'q' to quit displaying display list - monitor.c

* flags in "SHOW" displayed in a readable way - monitor.c

* new "STACK" command in monitor - monitor.c

* all printable ASCII characters displayed in "M" - monitor.c

* "ANTIC" registers display fixed - monitor.c

* better "HELP" in monitor - monitor.c

* write protection checked in ATR header and returned in drive status
  - atari.h, sio.c

* CRITIC flag reset and C flag set when returning from emulated SIO - sio.c



Changes in 0.9.9f
-----------------

o new binary loader fixed again (some binary files do not set starting
  address) <Marek>

Changes in 0.9.9e
-----------------

o new binary loader fixed (some binary files contain additional $FF,$FF
  in the block headers) <Marek>

o X11 keyboard autorepeat turned off during emulation <Marek>

o Antic: border color in GTIA 0x80 modes should be taken from $d012 not $d01a
  <ERU>

o GTIA: return 0x0f for all write-only registers <ERU>

o monitor: added filename to write (memory dump) <ERU>

o svgalib: don't abort if joystick cannot be opened. Also allow cursorpad
           keys/ctrl key for joystick emulation (enable it by defining
           USE_CURSORBLOCK) <Christian Groessler>


Changes in 0.9.9d
-----------------
 Almost all changes in this version came from Marek Zelem. Thanks to him
 we got digital sound effects (including keyboard clicking sound and other
 sound effects) in all ports of Atari800 now. This is very cool.
 Also svgalib and X11 support were improved. And a new binary loader was added.

+ New features for end users:
  - digital (volume only) sound (finally!)
  - emulation of console and disk drive sound
  - improved keyboard, joystick and screen support under X11
  - REALTIME mode for Linux - might speed up the emulator a bit
  - new routine for direct loading of single binary files
  - new cmdline command '-run program' that runs a program when emulator starts
  - fixed a bug in XL/XE mode after warmstart

List of changes for programmers:

o keyboard in X11 didn't generate KEYPRESSED - fixed. Also second joystick
  emulation was fixed. AKEY_HELP added. <Marek>

o X11 color support: if more than 256 colors then use full 256 colors in the
  emulator (in 8bpp only 128 colors are used) <Marek>

o support for REALTIME process under Linux added. This is disabled by default
  since it might hog the whole operating system. On slower systems this might
  increase the emulator speed so test it out if you run on a 486. <Marek>

o atari_sleep_ms(100) added to ui() into cycle for reading pressed keys.
  Emulator thus doesn't hog the operating system while waiting for a keypress.
  This is essential when Atari800 runs in REALTIME mode under Linux.  <Marek>

o digital sound (samples) emulation was added. It's enabled by default but
  you can disable it by defining NO_VOL_ONLY (who would disable it, anyway?)
  For better syncing a new global var cpu_clock was added. It's updated in
  cpu.c, cpu_nogoto.c after every instruction (cpu_m68k.s is not updated yet)
  This cpu_clock measures the number of physical ticks since the emulation
  started. <Marek>

o console sound emulation added (keyboard clicking sound and the beep that
  is produced by writting to CONSOL register). Can be disabled by a #define
  <Marek>

o disk I/O transfer sound emulation added (can be disabled by a #define).
  Hardcoded for 19200 bps for now. <Marek>

o the cmdline option '-refresh <num>' defines how often the screen is to
  be generated. Previously if num > 1 the screen generating was skipped
  (num-1) times but also interrupts weren't generated, no sound was produced
  and CPU ran a bit faster (full 114 cycles per screen line which is not
  possible under normal circumstances). Seems like this was meant for the
  BASIC or CURSES emulations.
  In this version the code for num > 1 was changed so that all interrupts
  are still generated, sound works OK and CPU runs at the right speed.
  Just the screen is not generated (antic.c) and not drawn (only in x11.c
  and svgalib.c for now - other platforms will be updated ASAP).
  This is driven by global var 'draw_display'.
  This new approach can be disabled anytime by defining VERY_SLOW. <Marek>

o Warm Start on 800XL/XE fixed - turns on the ROM OS now. <Marek>

o new BIN file loader added. Does not need a temporary .ATR disk image.
  Should be much better than the original attempt. Define USE_NEW_BINLOAD
  and test it out. <Marek>

o atari_x11.c: if screen is not visible do not update the emulated screen.
  Improves speed and is useful e.g. for listening the Atari800 music. Simply
  cover the emulator window with another window and the emulation runs faster.
  <Marek>

o atari_svgalib.c: support for running on an inactive virtual console, if
  allowed by the underlying svgalib. <Marek>

o sound recording added. Global variable 'sound_record' contains a file
  descriptor. If it's valid the played sound is written to the file.
  It's up to atari_*.c to turn the sound recording on/off. So far supported
  by CTRL-F8 under X11 only. <Marek>

o atari_x11.c and joystick: if the mouse is not over the Atari800 window
  (doesn't have the input focus) the joystick is not read.
  Also a preliminary 'experimental_mouse_joystick()' was added. As the name
  says this is an experiment of joystick emulation using the mouse. Not used
  yet. <Marek>

o trace-ing in monitor: doesn't display 24 insns after a single step. <Marek>

o Jari Karppinen sent a patch for new Allegro lib (v3.12)

o Christian Groessler sent a little patch for joystick under Linux

o all gets() were replaced by fgets() since the compiler complained.

o new configure stuff - configure.c, config.in, config.h and Makefiles
  Marek rewrote the configure stuff and introduced the config.in file. This
  is a great idea (something the emulator source needed for a long time).
  I tried to improve it even more (getting the idea from Linux kernel config
  stuff). It's not perfect yet but the main purpose - allow people to see
  and change all used #defines - works now. Also, my idea was to allow people
  to compile with or without ZLIB without editing the Makefiles and adding
  #define and -lz. This works too. Of course there's still a lot of work left,
  for example the (premise) as Marek calls it could allow logical operators 
  like OR, NOT and AND (using C symbols |, !, & or even ||, &&)

  The .atari800 file format has been changed. The positive thing is that it's
  now compatible between all platforms. The negative thing is that I had to
  move it from $HOME dir into the current source dir in order to get the
  include of Makefile working under DOS. I don't know make and Makefiles well
  so all fixes are welcome.


Changes in 0.9.9c
-----------------

+ New features for end users:
  - keyboard autorepeat in UI
  - separate current directories for operations in UI
  - better Linux SVGA support (including new 320x240 graphics mode)
  - new Linux SVGALIB keyboard handler
  - better sound (interpolation, less system load, configurable sound delay)

! coding style:
  - please do not change indentation of a source file unless you rewrote major
    part of it - this makes 'diff' impossible to use and causes hard time for
    people tracking changes between versions
  - use TABelators instead of spaces, if possible (set TAB size to 4 spaces)
  - you can use 'indent -kr -nce -ts4 source.c' to format the source file
  - if you're sending me diffs then please use diff -u (Unified), if possible

List of changes for programmers:

o TODO updated - volunteers, please read it.

o created new function 'atari_sleep_ms(ULONG ms)' that should be used
  everywhere in the emulator where you need to delay the execution for a while
  in a portable manner. Right now used in ui.c for keyboard autorepeat.
  #include "atari.h" for that.
  Architectures without usleep() and nanosleep() will edit just this function
  instead of polluting the whole source code by many #ifdefs.

  Similar thing needs to be done in the syncing code for main emulator loop
  in the atari.c.

o removed ALL warnings during compilation on DOS and Linux, with help of
  Jari Karppinen.
  Atari800 for DOS is known to have problems compiling under latest DJGPP 2.02
  and/or with latest Allegro 3.12. This will be fixed as soon as I download
  the above mentioned dev tools.

o ui.c: the keyboard repeat works on all platforms (thanks to 'atari_sleep_ms')
        some array size hardcoded constants replaced by #define FILENAME_SIZE
        memcpy(fname, ' ') and strcpy(fname, "  ") replaced by memset

o pokey.c: ULONG DivNIRQ[], DivNMAX[], TimeBase replaced by 'unsigned int'.
  This removed the warnings in Pokey[Read|Save]State(). It should not have any
  negative effects on machines where sizeof(long int) = sizeof(int).
  Linux-ia32, DOS/DJGPP and Atari Falcon/TT machines (all using GCC)
  should be OK.
  Is there an other computer/compiler with 16-bit ints or 64-bit longs that
  runs Atari800? If yes, state saving/restoring will neither work there,
  I think. And 16-bit ints would probably broke most of the emulator, anyway...


Following changes in 0.9.9c done by Krzysztof Nikiel <krzych00@priv7.onet.pl>

o new Makefile.linux (Makefile.unix still works for Linux)

o pokeysnd.c: added sound interpolation to reduce dsp frequency interference
  (now should work good even at low rates) and required main output loop
  reorganization.

o sound.c: added correct dsp device handling. Now shouldn't slow down
  the emulation.
  added option '-dsprate <rate>' and changed default rate to 22050 Hz (why?)
  added option '-snddelay <miliseconds>' that allows tuning sound delay
                according to interval betwen sound updates

o sound_dos.c: buffersize increased from 400 to 440 bytes

o sbdrv.c: divided sound buffer into four parts.

o Linux svgalib: better utilized svgalib capabilities;
  used mode 320x240x256;
  removed vgagl dependency;
  added status of disk LED;

o ui.c : bug in SaveState - no terminating zero at end of string
  separate current dirs for different operations
  refresh screen bug in GetKeyPress
  added keyboard autorepeat


Changes in 0.9.9b
-----------------

o fixed SD and ED floppy formatting in SIO code (sector size is hardcoded)

o monitor's commands 'COLDSTART' and 'WARMSTART' perform the reboot
  immediately now (previously you have to give it the 'cont' command
  to actually perform the reboot).

o statesave bug in SaveINT fixed (negative integers weren't saved
  correctly). <Krzysztof>

o Makefile.unix updated - the rawkey lib is now essential for the
  linux-svgalib version of Atari800.

o Linux-svgalib version now recognizes F8 keypress for jumping to monitor


Changes in 0.9.9a
-----------------

o full NOVA graphics support on Falcon including double sized screen

o double buffering of screen on NOVA gfx

o 16,32-bit X11 shared memory support. Compile with -DSHM. <Cameron>
  Quote: "Just in case you're interested, here's a patch for Atari800 that will
        allow shared memory to be used in 16-bit and 32-bit colour modes.  There
      isn't much of a performance benefit on my system (the emulator's CPU usage
      drop from around 68% to 53%, but the X server rises from 5% to 28%) but it
      might be useful in some environments.

      It's a bit of a hack since it adds another copy of each frame's data, but
      it's probably the best that can be done without changing the
      non-interface-dependent code."

o SIO fix: register A should always contain 0 on return from ROM(?) <Marek>

o Unix fix: call select() in the main sync loop to reduce system load <Marek>

o SIO format fix: realsize is set - formatting should work (7 Cities of Gold)
  <Jindroush>. Though I think we probably should not call SizeOfSector since
  someone might want to reformat double density diskette to single density.
  Thus I think realsize = 128; should work better. Let's test that.

o Linux SVGALIB - proper keyboard support implemented using the rawkey lib
  (http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/ui)


Changes in 0.9.8
----------------

o antic.c: artif_mode is up to 4 (fixed) <Rich>

o compfile.c: ReadAtariExe() for direct loading of single EXE files (actually it
  creates a temporary ATR file) <Rich>

o sio.c: formatting of ATR disk images fixed <Rich>

o supercart.c: fixed RTIME month (months are zero indexed) <Rich>

o ui.c: added Run Exe option. The LoadState file calls fileselector now.

o rt-config.c: added two config options: EXE_DIR and STATE_DIR

o compfile.c: fixed a serious bug when using prepend_tmp_file()


Changes in 0.9.8g
-----------------

o Falcon030 direct VIDEL programming for 336x240 resolution, NOVA screen saver

o START/SELECT/OPTION keys on Atari fixed

o DOS drives for Atari (still needs to be fixed)

o "Load State", "Save State", "Back to emulated Atari"
  "Cold/Warm Start" reboots machine immediately

o fixed the CPU opcode 0xcb and removed the BCD tables definitely


Changes in 0.9.8f
-----------------

o PAGE BASED memory access implemented (partially). See memory*.[ch] files
  and possibly #define PAGED_MEM in memory.h to see the (speed) difference.
  <Jason>

o cpu.c: BCDtoDEC and DECtoBCD removed.
  WARNING - cpu_nogoto.c is out-of-date!

o cpu_asm.c, cpu_m68k.s updated <Gerhard>

o double buffering of screen output on Atari port <Gerhard>

o little fixes and general source cleanup (rcsid's were removed, at last)
  <Jason>


Changes in 0.9.8e
-----------------

o Antic address counters fixed (both DisplayList and ScreenAddress). Salmon
  Run and other games should now scroll the screen correctly. The bug was found
  by Jindroush.

o SelfTest must be disabled when OS ROM is disabled (suggested by Jindroush).

o cpu_m68k.s is corrected (stack bug found and fixed). Spelunker runs now.
  <Gerhard>


Changes in 0.9.8d
-----------------

o introduced #ifdef ZLIB_CAPABLE. Emulator is now compilable without
  the zlib files.

o deleted file 'djgpp.h' and added O_BINARY to all O_RDONLY in open() calls.

TODO: update UI and add there menu items for state saving and restoring


Changes in 0.9.8c
-----------------

o atari.c contains three functions that should rather be port-specific:
  - zlib_capable() should return TRUE if we're linked against ZLIB
  - prepend_tmpfile_path() should insert path to a Temp dir to supplied buffer
  - ReadDisabledROMs() should read ROM files from disk instead from state image
  The functions are not written yet (they just return FALSE or something like
  that). Emulator code is not compilable without zlib header files...

o cpu_m68k.s contains GetByte, PutByte and GenerateIRQ now. It's faster.
  <Gerhard>


Changes in 0.9.8b
-----------------

o SIO bug fix: sectors are counted from 1! <Jindroush>

o new icon for Atari800 emulator

o State Saving - a new feature that allows saving the state of emulated
  environment anytime (in the VBL, actually) and restoring it later.
  <Rich>

o cpu_m68k.s (assembler module for CPU 6502 emulation on M680x0 machines)
  was updated (undocumented commands), corrected (Bruce Lee works now)
  and greatly improved (profilling support, speed). <Gerhard>


Changes in 0.9.8a
-----------------

o added compfile.c for handling DCM and ZLIB compressed files. SIO module 
  updated. Please add call to 'Clear_Temp_Files()' into Atari800_Exit() in
  all Atari800 ports. <Rich>

o some more printfs changed to Aprints (not sure if everything still
  works correctly in all ports). <Rich>

o CTIA (artifacting mode 4) added. <Rich>

o DOS port: vertical retrace control in display functions (animations
  are now much smoother) for both "official" and Allegro Dos versions.
  It will probably need a fast CPU to work fine.
  Vertical retrace is normally turned off, it may be activated by command
  line '-vretrace' option or by adding 'VRETRACE=1' to atari800.cfg. <Kuba>


Changes in 0.9.7
----------------

o CPU.C has got several new macros for stack (PH, PHW, PL) and memory
  access (dGetByte, dPutByte, dGetWord). This is intented for easier
  implementation of future memory management. <Jason>

o new command line switch "-nopatchall" and option in config file
  "ENABLE_ROM_PATCH". If you disable ROM patches (either by setting the
  ENABLE_ROM_PATCH to 0 or by using "-nopatchall") it will automatically
  disable the SIO patch as well. But the main purpose of this is to get
  a clean Atari800 ROM so Self-Test is happy when testing CRC and
  some games that search for certain device in HATABS do work now.
  <idea by Jindroush>

o new undocumented GTIA priority ("transparent missiles") added. The 5th
  player colour of missiles is transparent in mode 9 and 11.
  Also it fixes a bug in the earlier implementation of gtia mode 11
  There is also a major change in the way priorities are handled which
  is designed to be faster somewhat, it seems to help a bit with demos
  that cover the screen with players. It will probably not help too much
  for other programs. <Perry>

o #define BIG_ENDIAN -> POKEYSND_BIG_ENDIAN (why Linux-ix86 defines
  BIG_ENDIAN???). <Perry>

o NTSC patch to get Joust running under A5200. <Perry>

o new: support of R-Time 8 cartridge. Try to type 'date' or 'time' under 
  SpartaDOS. <Jason>

o new: artifacting in ANTIC mode 2. <Perry>

o PM DOS version: sound routines (DOSSOUND.C) do not need SEAL library
  as it uses ALLEGRO lib now. ALLEGRO is capable of sound card auto detection.
  New code uses just double buffering (previously tripple buffered) and the
  value of gain was reduced to fix some problems with digital sound.
  Edit ALLEGRO.CFG to change sample rate and thus sound quality.
  <Perry>

o CPU 6502 emulation core adapted to not use goto's all over the place.
  Also the jump table was replaced by switch() statement, which should be
  optimized into jump table by any modern compiler, anyway.
  This has various results - under MSVC it speeded up the emulation,
  while under GNU C on MC68040 it actually slowed the emulator down
  (about 10%, which is too much). The new core is available in file
  CPU_NOGOTO.C and is not used by default, however you may experiment
  with it under your architecture. <Rich>

o SIO DVSTAT byte 1 changed from 128 to 255 in order to get Strip Poker
  running. <Rich>

o WIN32 related additions and changes <Rich>

o stricmp() -> strcasecmp() in ui.c

o TVmode enum members PAL and NTSC had to be changed to TV_PAL and TV_NTSC
  (PAL and NTSC were already defined in falcon.h header file)

o ESCape code for SIO invoking (at 0xe459) has got an additional check to
  ensure that SIO emulation layer is not called by mistake when CPU gets
  some random data instead of instructions (it used to cause mysterious
  locks up of emulator). All other system patches should be protected this
  way, I think.

o ADDLOG and BACKUP_MSG were replaced with one universal routine in log.c
  called Aprint (syntax same as printf). All printf() should be replaced
  with this Aprint() routine that buffers the messages on systems where
  the emulator runs in a special graphics mode (DOS/Falcon/Win32) and does
  not want to have screen filled with a mess instead of debug reports.

o Falcon port cleaned up a lot: cflib removed, three different routines
  for chunky-to-planar conversion in 320x240, 352x240 and 384x240 resolutions
  were replaced with one universal routine that works in any resolution and
  centers the screen view automatically. The default resolution for Falcon
  is 336x240 now. It also is NOT a Falcon specific port anymore, as it now 
  supports any Atari compatible hardware with MC68020 or higher and 8-bit
  color graphics (320x240 is the minimum resolution for starting emulator).
  It also supports LED emulation (floppy LED blinking during SIO activity).

o source is compilable with -Wall, all previously uninitialised variables are
  set to 0.

o UI: long file names in Disk Selection dialog are shortened now. <Jindroush>

o Colour Artifacting! Use '-artif <MODE>' command line switch to enable
  the artifacting. Mode is number between 0 and 3. <Perry>

o the WIN32 specific code for artifacting in antic was removed.

o DOS specific files clean up and fixes (a lot). <Golda>

o PIA: fixed support for four joysticks in Atari800, tested on some games.
  Improved emulation of joystick ports on XL/XE. Some games obviously
  switch the ports into output state(!) and then read it. One would say
  there is nothing but $FF when the port is in output state and you read
  from it, but the real life is different. Atari800 emulator now supports
  this hardware trick correctly. <Golda>

o UI: better directory tree browsing support in Select Disk, in MS-DOS you
  can even select disk drives. <Golda>


Changes in 0.9.6
----------------

o DOS: keyboard and joystick handling changed a lot. Joysticks emulated
  on keyboard can now be freely defined to (nearly) any key combinations
  using comfortable JOYCFG.EXE tool. Besides, there are two modes of
  keyboard: Joystick mode and Normal mode. In Joystick mode the keypresses
  to joystick predefined keys are not passed to emulated environment.
  You can switch between Joystick and Normal mode on-the-fly by pressing
  the F7 key. <Golda>

o Falcon: NOVA graphics extended: 336x240 or 672x480 (double size)

o UI: the too fast autorepeat was fixed - by disabling the repeat altogether.

o SIO: serious bug in CopyToMem fixed. No more rewritten ROM OS. <Jindroush>

o ANTIC patch: no player DMA without missile DMA. <Perry>

o SIO: missing 'else' in DIR routines. <Perry>

o Allegro VGA: updated Makefile and fixed ShutdownVGA(). <Perry, Golda>

o VCOUNT patch <suggested by Thor, but developed and tested by Perry>

o PIA_Initialise() should initialise PORTA to 0.

o PIA registers are mirrored not only in Atari800, but in XL/XE models
  as well (thus addr&=0xff03). Bounty Bob runs now?

o DOS: VESA2 mode support (about three times faster than X-mode). VESA2
  also preserves the refresh rate. You can disable VESA2 modes by switch
  -novesa. Also colour pallete initialisation is faster now. <Golda>

o DOS: Atari_Set_LED function (use -DSET_LED to enable that). <Golda>

o UI: the last ESC keypress is not passed to the emulated program anymore.
  <Golda>

o Monitor: pressing [Return/Enter] can be used for single stepping as well.
  <Golda>

o new routine for saving of screenshot in 336x240 size as PCX. So far used
  in DOS and Falcon ports (press F10 to save current screen into a file).
  <Golda>

o the Atari keyboard should now react quickly enough. DOS port contains
  keyboard buffer for last two keys. <Golda>

o fix for initialisation of PORTA <David Firth>

o DOS port: better joystick autodetection <Michael Beck>

o several fixes for more ANSI like C code <various people>

o ANTIC: fix for DLIST counter. <Thor, Perry>

o ANTIC: several more hardware registers are unreadable. <Perry>


Changes in 0.9.5
----------------

o ANTIC: fix for scrolling of empty lines. <Perry>

o CPU: little fix in remembering last N jumps. <Golda>

o new command line option: '-basic' to override Hold_Option in cfg file

o UI: you can now go into folders when selecting image in Disk Management
  <Preston>

o DOS port - finally full resolution 320x240, 320x480 interlaced. <Golda>

o SIO: ATR images created by SIO2PC are readable now. Also Read/Write
  Config was updated to reflect real XF551. <Michael>

o monitor continues last command by pressing [Return/Enter] key. <Michael>

o PIA: reading PORTA fixed (now works exactly like real Atari800,
  not compatible with Atari5200 yet). <Perry>

o UI fix: it's possible to disable disk drive by [Space] again.

o Gtia fix: CONSOL (Start/Select/Option keys) handling. <Perry>

o Pokeysnd: poly4 and poly5 bit fields were changed for more accurate
  sound emulation. The original values are still available with
  -DPOKEY23_POLY. <Perry>


Changes in 0.9.4
----------------

o CPU fixes: several unofficial instructions compared with real
  Atari800XE and their emulation fixed. ADC/SBC "V" bit bug found
  and fixed (Thor's code used, which in turn was taken from Frodo
  emulator, AFAIK). Compatibility greatly improved again! <RASTER>

o Antic fix: cycle counting when DMA is disabled (improves sound
  quality in non-interrupt driven sound update routines). <Perry>

o Voxware sound driver updated (tested under Linux).
  pokey11.[ch] files removed. <Robert Brewer>

o the crashing in UI when switching to Atari5200 mode fixed. <Perry>

o internal monitor improved (symbolic names for often used hardware
  registers etc). Line assembler implemented. Single instruction
  step mode implemented.
  Monitor remembers not only last N PC addresses, but also
  last N jumps. To enable these features edit your Makefile
  CFLAGS = -DMONITOR_BREAK -DMONITOR_HINTS -DMONITOR_ASSEMBLER.
  <Golda>

o additional WIN32 code (Atari800 User Interface is used in
  Windows port now) <Rich>

o all Hardware_GetByte(address) routines return 0xff for unknown 
  address now.

o fixed several files so Makefile.allegro works now. <Perry>

o NMIEN is not readable now. <Thor>


Changes in 0.9.3
----------------

o POKEY interrupts implemented (inspired by Thor's version).
  Ghostbusters run now! :-)

o NOVA graphics support on Atari TT/Falcon computers finished.
  Atari800 is no longer Atari Falcon specific port, now it works
  on any TOS compatible machine with MC68020 or higher and a NOVA
  graphics card (please test in on Medusa, Hades and Milan machines)

o A special check for pending IRQ put into CLI, PLP and RTI insns.
  It's a macro for speed reasons, though a function might be more
  appropriate.

o A new function GenerateIRQ() was written in CPU module and is used
  where needed (ATARI and POKEY modules).

o Handling of IRQ's changed. Before, we tested for IRQEN (is interrupt
  enabled?) and then (in positive case) we set IRQST.
  Now, we always set the IRQST and then we take an action only if
  IRQEN is OK. I don't know if it's OK, I have just been told that
  more demos work with this.

o all HardwareGetByte(address) routines return now 0 for unknown 
  address (probably not ideal, but deterministic at least).

o several routines from ANTIC, CPU and POKEYSND modules moved to
  POKEY module, where they actually belong.

o CPU emulation fixed (INDIRECT_X mode was overflowing) <Thor,
  Golda, RASTER>

o CPU and Antic speeded up *slightly* by using type casts instead
  of direct anding with 0xff (the compiler got a chance to 
  optimize it at least). <RASTER>

o a lot of uneccessary castings to (UWORD) and (UBYTE) was removed
  from CPU emulation

o DiskDir of UI enhanced - now you can define up to eight
  directories where disk images are stored - then you can
  go through these directories in Disk Management by pressing
  TAB key. <Golda>

o fixed sorting of file list in Disk management in DOS port 
  (a speciality of strcmp() function of DJGPP libc). <Golda>


Changes in 0.9.2
----------------

o LPTjoy implemented. Now you can connect up to three old style
  CX-40 (Atari, Amiga digital joysticks) to the printer ports
  of your PC (via a very simple interface). Then you just specify
  "-LPTjoy1" on command line for joystick on LPT1 etc.
  LPTjoy idea came from Petr Sumbera.

o m68k assembler CPU emulation was updated to reflect recent
  changes in CPU module <Empty Head>.

o preliminary support for NOVA graphics on Falcon

o Allegro joystick routines slightly improved (now you can
  play even without real joystick)

o Atari800Win changes were put in the main source tree <Rich>

o after selecting another OS from UI emulator doesn't hang if
  there is no ROM file.


Changes in 0.9.1
----------------

o new POKEY v2.4 with sound channels filtering! Exclusively
  written by Ron Fries for Atari800 emulator. Thanks, Ron!

o merge of Perry's and (RASTER & Petr)'s source tree - great!
  Current source can be compiled for DOS by either Makefile.dos
  or by Perry's Makefile.allegro. Perry's Makefile needs DOS game
  library Allegro. The only functional difference between these
  two DOS versions is that Makefile.allegro enables keyclicks
  (due to different sound handling).

o major rewrite of DOS keyboard emulation - now allows two
  modes of operation: native (the labels on English PC keyboard
  are valid) and original (the keyboard layout is the same as
  the original Atari800 keyboard). You can switch between these
  two modes on-the-fly by pressing Control+F1 and Shift+F1).
  Better handling of START/SELECT/OPTION keys (these console keys
  are independent of the rest of keyboard).
  Screen view movement changed to Control-numeric pad (just
  like emulated joy, but with Control key). <RASTER>

o ANTIC speeded up by narrowing the screen width to 42 chars
  (originally it was 48 chars wide, but no TV can show more 
  than about 43 chars..). This should speed things up for
  about 10% in wide modes and PM graphics. <Perry>

o Emulation of 320 kB of memory added. Two different modes are
  supported - Rambo and Compy Shop. Extended memory tested by
  Q-meg (alternative operating system for Atari320XE).
  ROM/ShadowRAM and AtariXL Basic switching optimized. <RASTER>

o Atari5200 emulation corrected (loading of ROMs, keyboard,
  paddles). Special support for Bounty Bob on Atari5200
  added. <Perry>

o new SIO code that supports formatting (written by <thor>,
  updated by Perry and Petr).


Changes in 0.9.0
----------------

o slight speed up in antic.c <Perry>

o the right-most vertical line was missing on screen <RASTER>

o DOS: BREAK key should not have auto-repeat,  Invers key added
  <RASTER>

o ANTIC now contains #ifdef POKEY_UPDATE. That should be defined
  in Makefiles for architectures where it's impossible to update
  sound buffers in DMA interrupt (i.e. Unices etc)

o source cleaned up (no C++ style of comments), docs updated


Changes in 0.8.9
----------------

o ANTIC's DIRECT_VIDEO mode was completely rewritten. Now it is the
  default mode of emulation, much faster than the previous approach.
  This version of ANTIC is also 'line-oriented' - that means video
  emulation is accurate to single scanlines. It allows such tricks
  like changing charset during displaying an ANTIC text mode line.
  ANTIC's scrolling in both horizontal and vertical direction is now
  supported in all graphics modes. Thanks Perry for all these things.

o GTIA now supports all possible combinations of PMG collisions. It
  also supports third colour (many games are much more colourful now,
  just like they were on original Atari800). Thanks Thomas Richter and
  Perry.

o -configure now preloads the default filenames of ROM images. It also
  presets hold_option to 1 (for game players is better not to confuse
  them with Atari Basic). <RASTER>

o xcolpf1 kludge was removed (antic, gtia, rt-config files).
o DIRECT_VIDEO support was removed (configure.c)
o the compilation config file is named atari800.djgpp on DOS, so it
  finally doesn't collide with atari800.cfg (config file of emulator itself)
o sio.c opens files in binary mode - works on DOS

o Atari800 monitor changes: disassembler rewritten (now recognizes all 256
  opcodes and displays also cycles and hex codes), different (more logical?)
  commands: [D]isassembler, [C]hange memory, dump [M]emory (previously Y, M, D)
  <RASTER>

o Fixed DMACTL and GRACTL registers (difference between enabled PMG and enabled
  DMA for PMG). <RASTER>

o Introduced PMG flickering (try out POKE 53248,160:POKE 704,14:POKE 53277,3).
  <RASTER>

o DOS keyboard: added Ctrl-1 (stops scrolling), Ctrl-2 (bell), Ctrl-3 (EOF) and
  HOME key clears screen, END key stands for Atari BREAK key. INSERT and DELETE
  keys insert and delete chars or whole lines (with Shift and Control keys).


Changes in 0.8.8
----------------

o Antic, GTIA and CPU are now synchronized. Very precise timing
  (up to 99.87% compared to real Atari800XE) with CPU cycle counting
  was implemented by RASTER. This should be the final solution for
  numerous DLI problems.

Changes in 0.8.7
----------------

o snailmeter (speed indicator on the screen) is disabled automatically
  when the host computer is fast enough for emulating the Atari800 at 
  full speed.

o Atari_Scanline() function was optimized - should be up to twice as fast
  as was before.

o Falcon: keyboard emulation of joystick was fixed once more. Now you can
  hold down several keys at once and it works OK.

o DOS: joystick is autodetected. If not present, keyboard emulates joy1.
  If real joy is detected, keyboard emulates joy2. If "-joyswap" command
  on command line is used, the joy1 and joy2 are exchanged.

Changes in 0.8.6
----------------

o improved IRQ handling in CPU (CLI instruction) - now Rescue on Fractalus
  reacts on keyboard presses

o Falcon: real DMA sound with interrupt driven buffer recalculation using
  Ron Fries POKEY 2.3

o DOS: keyboard fix of HASH mark (Shift-3)

o Falcon: keyboard fix of joystick emulation

o DOS version starts even when sound card is not initialized (emulator is now
  able to run under WindowsNT 4.0)

o Falcon detects current video mode and doesn't touch VIDEL registers 
  if it's 320/352/384x240x8bp (see the -resolution switch) - Atari800 should
  now run on RGB monitors as well.

o fixed little typo in BACK_SLASH (thanks Perry)

o improved DOS and Falcon keyboard emulation (common KEYPRESSED and SHIFT_KEY)
  DOS version now recognizes extended keys properly - joystick emulation is OK
  (Chimera, BruceLee and others are now playable)

o XL operating system is turned on in Coldstart routine.

o keyboard IRQ are set only if allowed by IRQEN

o DOS port emulates TAB and HELP key (HELP is mapped to F10 - not optimal,
  should be changed to another key - perhaps F6, which is useless in XL mode)

o DOS port has faster screen update with dosmemputl (Perry)

o files on virtual drive are opened in binary mode (Perry)
  and are listed in uppercase (RASTER's suggestion)

o fixed bug in SIO_Mount causing crashes when mounting drives in Disk management

o in System menu (F1) copy font from operating system and not from shadow RAM
  (another XL related bug fix)

o added support for '\\' in file paths (see #define BACK_SLASH)

Changes in 0.8.4
----------------

o fixed bug in vertical scrolling (visible for example in Archon intro) - 
  thanks to Perry McFarlane


o DMA sound for Falcon version (using POKEY 2.2). Buffer recalculation is
  not interrupt driven yet.

o Error messages are buffered until the original text mode is restored
  (see #define BACKUP_MSG)

o Falcon version supports up to two joysticks

o Snailmeter :-) A kind of indicator for slow machines - it shows you
  how many times is the emulator slower than real Atari800. On my
  Afterburner (68040 @ 40 MHz) it's about three or four times slower
  than original :-( If your machine is fast enough, the snailmeter
  is not visible. So watch the lower bottom of screen! :-)

Changes in 0.8.3
----------------

o Radek Sterba (raster@infos.cz) did a marvelous work on discovering
  unofficial 6502 instructions. This CPU.C has implemented _all_ 256
  opcodes! He added more than 70 unofficial instructions, many of them
  were even unkown before. ESC code had to be changed from 0xff to 0xf2
  (0xff is a kind of 'regular' instruction, while 0xf2 is the CIM).
  Atari800 is the world's first 6502 emulator with full instruction set!
  100% software compatibility with original 6502.

o I've integrated his code and fixed JMP (addr) for addr crossing 
  page boundary (6502 was 'buggy', though 65C02 should had this fixed).

o IRQ variable has been changed from int to UBYTE (for C it shouldn't matter
  and it helps in the m68k asm code).

o Disk images created by XFormer and its utilities (having extension
  .XFD or .DD) may be of double density - I implemented it in sio.c
  (see #ifdef ORIGINAL_XFD_CODE). Tested and works (glad to get it working,
  because I have a lot of XFD images).

o In DOS/VGA version you can move the 320x200 screen around with Ctrl-Arrows
  to see full 384x240 resolution of original Atari800. To restore the VGA
  screen back to center press F10.

o DOS/VGA version supports one real PC joystick (emulated in port 1).
  You still can use the numeric keypad as emulated joystick - by default
  in port 1, or in port 2 with "-joyswap" command line switch. Joystick
  doesn't have the ghost-moves (interrupts are disabled during joy reading).
  Also joystick is not read whenever the Atari800 wants it, but only in the
  keyboard routine (i.e. regularly 50 times per second, basically in VBL).
  This was important to prevent a game reading joy port too often to hang
  or slow the emulation down (reading of PC joystick takes some time).

o DOS port has finally got wonderfully clear sound, thanks to Ron Fries'
  SoundBlaster Driver 1.2 and new, little/big-endian aware POKEY 2.2 routines.

o New monitor S command for searching a value in memory.

o The best news: found the reason why so many games didn't work in XL mode.
  Fixed one MMU bug (XL didn't have TRIG2 and TRIG3 was connected to
  cartridge) and introduced one MMU workaround (many 800-only games put
  zero to PORTB. That's why Tapper and other games didn't work). Now the
  compatibility ratio of Atari800 in XL/XE mode is at 97% or higher - 
  definitely the most compatible Atari800/XL/XE emulator in the world.

Changes in 0.8.2Petr
----------------

o Fixed wrong missile width (all missiles had the same width) - now River
  Raid looks much better.

o Added 28 cycles in Antic after executing DLI - it was absolutely needed,
  because otherwise the interrupt routine was executed too late and the
  effects (color or font change) occured with another Antic line - now
  Pitfall II has the score displayed in numbers and not in characters.

o Added several checks into SIO code for seeking() after end of file - 
  on Falcon it caused enlarging of disk images (for example the well
  known MENU.ATR has original size 1296 bytes, but after rebooting
  of Atari800 the file was enlarged to 2598672 bytes). Maybe it's
  a hidden endianess problem in SIO code? It happened on Amiga, too.

o Added a method of invoking Monitor - by pressing the F8 key anytime
  during emulation.

o Added BREAK command into Monitor. Now it's possible to enter monitor,
  use command BREAK <addr> and then CONT. The emulator then runs until
  the PC (program counter) is exactly <addr>. Then the monitor is invoked
  again.

o DOS version has got joystick support and also sound support using Ron
  Fries Pokey Emulation 2.0. The joystick is OK, but the sound is not
  clear - need to change to interrupt driven sound buffer generating.

o Atari800 has been ported to Atari Falcon (32-bit machine with MC68030
  or MC68040 and flexible graphics processor). Besides the port this
  Falcon version contains special CPU 6502 emulation written in pure
  MC68030 assembler by Empty Head (Karel Rous), special very fast routines
  for chunky2planar conversion (written by Douglas Little @ Black Scorpion)
  and special code for VIDEL programming (provided by Douglas as well).
  The keyboard and joystick emulation, the port itself and the fixes 
  mentioned above were done by me, Petr Stehlik (stehlik@cas3.zlin.vutbr.cz).

Changes in 0.8.2David
----------------

o New Monitor READ command to load file into memory.
o New Monitor COLDSTART command to perform a coldstart.
o New Monitor WARMSTART command to perform a warmstart.
o New Monitor F command to fill memory range with a value.
o Prevention of "config.h" being included during compilation for Amiga.
o Improved MS-DOS keyboard handling. The most noticable difference is
  that the keypad joystick emulation now returns to centre when the
  key is released.
o Re-instated replacement OS - Allows Defender and Star Raider to
  run without the Atari OS Roms.
o Added Atari Falcon Support - Thanks to Petr Stehlik.
o NAS (Network Audio System) support is now obsolete. The entries have
  been removed from the makefile and the intention is to remove the
  obsolete code before the next release.

Changes in 0.8.1
----------------

o Added -private_cmap flag for X11 version.

o Correction to handling of 6502 V flag during ADC and SBC operations.

Changes in 0.8.0
----------------

o Added Ron Fries Pokey Emulation routines for sound in Linux.
  A million thanks to Ron for releasing these routines - I've
  put off using sound for ages but it took less than an evening
  to add sound using these routines :-)

  Sound is setup for Linux using /dev/dsp but it also seems to
  produce something using /dev/audio, which leads me to believe
  that it should work on most Unix boxes with a little work.
  Patches welcomed :-)

  In order to support sound I've added a few new command line
  options:-

  -sound and -nosound do what you'd expect.

  -dsp_divisor takes a decimal value which alters the quality of
               the sound output. It is used to work out how much
               sound should be created each time the screen is
               refreshed. Ideally it should be 50 (PAL) or 60 (NTSC)
               but I've found that the best value to use is about
               5 less than the emulators screen refresh rate WITH
               SOUND DISABLED. If the values is to high you will
               get gaps in the sound. If the value is to low the
               emulator will run slower than it should.

               I strongly suggest you experiment with this parameter
               in order to get both the best sound and performance.

o Support for an Experimental New Cartridge Format - with the use of
  OSS Super Cartridges there is no way of automatically
  distinguishing standard 16K cartridges from the various Super
  Cartridges. Hopefully this format will do for cartridges what ATR
  files did for disk images. Feedback and view would be welcomed
  especially from the other Emulator Authors.

  The current format is :-

  first 4 bytes containing 'C' 'A' 'R' 'T'.
  next 4 bytes containing cartridge type in MSB format.

    Type 1 - Standard 8K Cartridge
    Type 2 - Standard 16K Cartridge
    Type 3 - OSS Super Cartridge (I heard rumours that there are two
             different types of OSS Cartridges)
    Type 4 - Atari 5200 Cartridge

    Note: There is probably a case for extra cartridge types
          indicating the system that needs to be emulated.
          e.g. Standard 8K Cartridge (800 Mode Only).

  next 4 bytes containing cartridge checksum in MSB format (ROM only).
  next 4 bytes are currently unused.
  followed immediately with the ROM data, typically 8, 16 or 32K.

  In the next version I'm intending on adding:-
    32 bytes for Cartridge Name
    32 bytes for Cartridge Serial Number
    32 bytes for Manufacturer

  The current version of the emulator includes options in the
  Cartridge Management screen to Create Cartridges in the above
  format but be warned this format is likely to change.

Changes in 0.7.1
----------------

o Note: I now consider the new Menu System that runs in the Emulated
        Atari's window to be the prefered User Interface. I have no
        intention of doing any further development for XVIEW

o Cartridge Management added to Menu.

o Removed FFP Code.

Changes in 0.7.0
----------------

o F1 enters Menu System at any time. ESC returns you to the previous
  screen. Items are lcoated using the cursor keys and selected by
  either RETURN, SPACE, TAB or BACKSPACE. In most cases these keys
  can be used interchangeably, the exception is in the Disk Management
  Screen where RETURN is used to select a new disk and SPACE, TAB and
  BACKSPACE are used to eject a disk - If there is no disk in the
  virtual drive then SPACE, TAB and BACKSPACE will switch the drive
  off (Useful for Shamus).

o X11, SVGALIB & DOS - F5 is now Warmstart and Shift F5 is Coldstart.

o X11 - F8 Single Shot Screen Dump, Shift F8 continuous Screen Dumps.

o MS-DOS version runs about three times quicker now that the emulator is
  synchronising with a high resolution timer.

o MS-DOS version resets the screen back to text mode when finished.

Changes in 0.6.2
----------------

o Antic Modes 2, 3 and f now display the normal Atari Colour and
  Luminance by default. Extended Antic Modes 2, 3 and f are enabled
  by starting the emulator with the "-xcolpf1" command line option.
  This allows two completely different colours to be displayed in
  these modes - as previously.

o Improved Run-Time Configuration. Starting emulator with the "-configure"
  command line option allows configuration of several items:-

     1. Location of OS Roms
     2. Default Directory for Disk Images
     3. Default Directory for ROM Images
     4. Default Directory for H1, H2, H3 and H4 pseudo devices
     5. Command Print File (for Printer Support)
     6. Default Screen Refresh Ratio
     7. Default Startup System (OS/A, OS/B, XL, XE, 5200)
     8. Default TV Mode (PAL, NTSC)
     9. Hold Option during Coldstart
    10. Enable C000-CFFF RAM in Atari 800 mode
    11. Enable SIO Patch
    12. Enable FFP Patch
    13. Enable Extended COLPF1 (Two true colours in Antic Modes 2, 3 & F)

  The emulator writes a file called "atari800.cfg" in your default
  directory. When reading the configuration the emulator first checks
  to see if you've specified a configuration on the command line with
  the "-config" option otherwise it first tries to read a configuration
  file from your default directory, failing this it then tries to read
  a configuration file from "/etc/atari800.cfg".

o JoyMouse for Toshiba Portables running SVGALIB - Probably also
  suitable for Trackball devices with minor modifications.

Changes in 0.6.1
----------------

*** IMPORTANT MESSAGE for EXISTING Users of Atari800 (Source Versions)

You will need to make some changes during the sytem configuration
stage - the emulator now expects the full path to each of the system
ROM images to be explicitly stated. If you don't have all the ROM
images then just pretend you have!

o FPS and SIO Monitor are no longer compile time configuration options.
  Enabled by "-fps" or "-sio" command line option or via an XVIEW
  pulldown menu.
o Motif fileselector retains state from one invocation to the next.
o Configuration program detects if longwords need to be aligned.
o Modification to X11 Paddle Emulation.
o Removed hardcoded paths in MOTIF code.
o Various fixes for curses mode.
o Correction to Colours in Antic Modes 4&5 causing Incorrect colours
  in Rally Speedway, Galactic Chase and Mr. DO)
o Disabled DiskChange KEY (F8) in X11 version.
o Added "-nobasic" command line parameter.
o Added "-osa_rom", "-osb_rom", "-xlxe_rom", "-5200_rom" and "-basic_rom".
  These command line options are used to specify the location of
  various system ROMs on mis-configured systems or binary distributions.

Note: To prevent cluttering up the CHANGES file all credits are listed
      in the CREDITS file.

Changes in 0.6.0
----------------

- Emulator can now be compiled for DOS using the DJGPP port of GCC (Thanks
  to Ivo van Poorten)

Thanks to Maximum Entropy for the following Changes:-
- Implementation of Disable Drive menu item for Motif.
- Fixed scrolling problem for machines that can't access longwords on word
  boundaries (e.g. SGI and SPARC).
- Added FPS Monitor to X11 and Motif versions.
- Changes to pattern matching for H: device.

Changes in 0.5.5
----------------

Thanks to Maximum Entropy for the following Changes:-
- Various corrections to MOTIF code.
- MOTIF callbacks for Insert Disk, Eject Disk and Insert ROM
- Bug Fixes in sio.c
- Bug Fix to devices.c allowing DOS 2.5 to get a directory of H:
- Bug Fix to monitor.c (EOF on INPUT + Blank Lines)
- Undocumented commands added to monitors HELP command.

Changes in 0.5.4
----------------

- Made Emulator C++ Friendly.
- BASIC version has not been working since CPU cycles were allocated during
  scanlines processing. This problem was caused because the BASIC version
  doesn't generate any scanlines and therefore didn't execute any
  instructions. This version fixes the problem.

Changes in 0.5.3
----------------

- Removed GetWord macro from cpu.c
- Added XVIEW option to disable drive (via SIO_DisableDrive()). This
  allows SHAMUS to work. The drive is automatically re-enabled next
  time a disk is inserted.

Changes in 0.5.2
----------------

- Made CPU timing more accurate: It now issue 114 clock cycles per scanline
  instead of 48 instructions.
- Removed obsolete functions: GetBinaryWord() and BinaryLoad().
- Handle PORTA Direction Control Register. Fixes Joystick problem in Caverns
  of Mars 1.
- The atari_basic array was incorrectly defined in pia.c as [8129]. This
  has now been corrected to [8192] (Thanks to Chris Palmer).

Changes in 0.5.1
----------------

- Changed handling of CONSOL for X11 versions - previously it was hard
  to start some games.
- Changed address of 5200 POKEY chip. The information I have states that
  it is located in page $eb, but evidence in a disassembled cart suggests
  its at $e8. Of course it could appear in both pages, does anyone
  know for sure?
- CPU time allocation is now performed entirely within "antic.c". This is
  a pre-condition for switchable PAL/NTCS modes.
- Compile time configurable to either PAL [default] or NTCS system.
- "-countdown" option has been removed.

Changes in 0.5.0
----------------

- Simplified interface to CPU module.
- DIRECT_VIDEO now works with PMG collision detection. This option increases
  performance by about 28% but can result in different colours being displayed.
  This is because this option relies on COLPF0, COLPF1, COLPF2, COLPF3 and
  COLBK all having different values, hence the emulator sometimes modifies
  the colours :-( This option can be enabled during the configuration phase.
- Correction to ANTIC Mode 5 Vertical Scrolling.
- Correction to PMG DMA Code - Demon Attack now works OK.
- Added code to limit the emulator to 50fps - this will not have any
  effect if your machine can't run the emulator greater than 50fps.
  F10 in X11, XVIEW, MOTIF and SVGALIB versions toggles the limit on/off.
  When the limit is off the emulator will go as fast as it can.
- Path to directory containing the OS ROM images is now defined during
  the configuration phase (Declaration of ATARI_LIBRARY has been removed
  from the Makefile).
- Correction to handling of PMG DMA - Pitfall II now Works.
- The unused bits in PMBASE are now ignored correcting errors in Atari Chess
  and Frogger.

Changes in 0.4.5
----------------

- Added a compile time configuration option to control the default
  screen refresh rate. In previous version of the emulator the default
  rate has been 4 frame: draw 1 skip 3. From this version you will
  be prompted for the default during the compile stage (except VMS and
  AMIGA which still default to 4). A value of 1 is required for the
  most accurate emulation. Values other than one can produce some
  collision detection problems on a few programs (e.g. Burried Bucks).
- Split Custom Chip code into seperate files.
- Added 5200 Emulation Code - Runs program but needs modifications to
  support 5200 controllers. The 2K OS ROM must be called "atari5200.rom"
  and placed in the same directory as the other OS ROMS.
- Linux Joystick enabled by configuration program. There are nolonger
  any makefile targets containing "joystick".
- Removed code relating to Emulated Operating System.
- Added option that displays the number of Frames per Second. This option
  is enabled within the configuration program and currently only works
  with the XVIEW version.

Changes in 0.4.4
----------------

- SpartaDOS 3.2 works for both Read and Write Access.
- Alternate Reality "The City" now works.
- Added interrupt timings for Invalid SIO commands.
- Support for Direct Serial I/O Write and Put sectors commands.
- Correction for Double Density ATR files.

Changes in 0.4.3
----------------

- Corrected a Bug that prevented DOS 2.5 from copying files to/from H:
- Re-instated F8 Disk Change function for non XVIEW/MOTIF/AMIGA Systems.

Changes in 0.4.2
----------------

- Test code for faster screen generation, enabled by defining DIRECT_VIDEO
  within "atari_custom.c". It needs a little more thought with respect to
  collision detection, hence it is disabled by default.
- Better PMG Priority Handling.
- Tidied up code accessing hardware registers
- Changed handling of B, D and I flags.
- Changed handling of NMIs.

Changes in 0.4.1
----------------

- Flashes background colour while performing direct Serial I/O
- Minor optimisation to Player/Player collision detection
- Minor changes in CPU emulation
- Correction to new cartridge code causing it to fail under XL/XE
  emulation (Thanks to Neil Shipp)
- New targets in the Makefile for freebsd systems (Thanks to Ivo
  van Poorten)

Changes in 0.4.0
----------------

- Added MOTIF User Interface
- Support for DEC-Windows under VMS (Thanks to Chris F Chiesa)
- Removed dependency on 'ncycles' global variable.
- Support for direct access to serial port hardware - The emulator will
  now run Alternate Reality "The Dungeon" (I haven't tried the others)
- Modified handling of XL/XE memory.
- Fixed the GTIA modes which broke after X Window shared memory support
  was added in version 0.3.0
- Correction allowing Montezumas Revenge to work again.

Changes in 0.3.3
----------------

- New System menu in XVIEW version allowing selection of operating
  system etc.
- Amiga: Iconify working.
- Amiga: System menu contains options for Insert ROM, Remove ROM,
  Enable PILL, Selection of Operating System and all previous disk
  options.
- Amiga: Help menu option is now working using Multiview.

Changes in 0.3.2
----------------

- Modified BRK instruction to take account of the I flag. The BRK
  instruction is ignored if the I flag is set.
- Added all unofficial NOP opcodes.
- New cartridge handling. The XVIEW version provides menu items
  enabling the insertion and removal of cartridges.

Changes in 0.3.1
----------------

- Defined PRINT_COMMAND in devices.c for Amiga
- Minor optimisation to PMG handling
- Modified DLI Handling and ScanLine processing

Changes in 0.3.0
----------------

- Support for Atari 130XE memory banks (Antic currently accesses the
  same bank as the CPU)
- XVIEW Exit item on the Disk menu.
- Printer device calls tmpnam() to allocate a temporary filename for
  the spool file.
- XView version didn't enable HELP key for XL and XE emulation.
- X11 Backspace keys works in the same ways as the Delete key.
  (Thanks to Cyrus Malek)
- Reset and Coldstart now work during XL and XE emulation.
- Added OK button to XVIEW controller and performance dialog boxes.
- Optional support for X11 Shared Memory Images resulting in a 32%
  speed improvement. This option can only be used in conjunction
  with the small screen display. Type make by itself to obtain
  the new list of targets. "-shm" target extension enables this
  option.
- Simple configuration program to avoid editing the Makefile as ofter.
  make will invoke it the first time and afterwards "make config" can
  be used. It currently handles the directories for the H: device, the
  disk image directory for the XVIEW file chooser and the command used
  to send a file to the printer. The print command should contain a %s
  character sequence where a filename is expected (only the first %s
  is relevant).

Changes in 0.2.7
----------------

- Renamed atari_h_device.c to a more general devices.c
- Emulator (private) opcode ESCRTS ($d2) added to support patching of OS.
- Printer device supported via Unix lpr command.
- Moved from RCS to CVS and added rcs Id keyword to all C files.
- Emulated OS: Better handling of Keyboard and ATASCII to screen
  code conversion. Editor uses LMARGN, RMARGN, ROWCRS and COLCRS.
- Many other changes to EmuOS including implementation of SETVBV
  COLDSV and WARMSV.
- Detection of X11 server supporting the MIT Shared Memory Extension in
  preperation for shared memory pixmaps.
- Corrected bug in H: device (filename extraction routine).

Changes in 0.2.6
----------------

- Corrected calculation of number of sectors and reading of double
  density ATR files (Thanks to Preston Crow)
- Correction for Linux ELF systems.
- XVIEW and NAS work under Linux/ELF
- Default directory for XVIEW Disk File Chooser is set within the
  Makefile. By default it is pointing to /usr/local/lib/atari/DISKS
- Corrected bug in Missile 0 to Playfield collision detection.
- Corrected WSYNC bug (multiple stores to WSYNC during one scanline).
  River Raid now runs correctly.
- -emuos to enable emulated operating system. Users without the
  necessary atari OS ROMs can use this option to boot disk images/ROMs.
  Currently this is very experimental and runs very little without
  problems. Defender runs perfectly but if you haven't got the OS it's
  unlikely you'll be able to get this either!
- H0: device accesses the current directory on your Unix Machine.
- H1: through H4: can access four directories specified either within
  the Makefile or via the -H1, -H2, -H3 and -H4 command line options.
  By default they are set to /usr/local/lib/atari/Hx where x is 1, 2,
  3 or 4.
- H5: through H9: duplicate H0 through H4 but have automatic ATASCII
  to ASCII translation. They are not suitable for binary files.
- All files accessed via the H: device have Unix filenames consisting
  entirely of lowercase letters.

Changes in 0.2.5
----------------

- Network Audio System support on Unix Systems [incl. Linux]. Waveform
  can be selected via the -sinewave or -squarewave options. At the
  moment it doesn't support the Atari Distortion values and switches
  channels using distortion off. This is available in XVIEW, X Window
  and Linux SVGALIB versions. The Network Audio System is freely
  available on the Internet - I used nas-1.2p2.tar.gz. Any Linux XVIEW
  version do not work when built with the Network Audio System.
  *** See BUGS file for more information ***
- Support for /dev/sequencer removed since it didn't look like it
  would ever produce satisfactory results.
- Introduced -help option that lists all options available in the
  emulator.
- Added LAX unofficial opcodes
- Corrected Vertical Fine scrolling in Antic Mode 7.
- Enhanced DLIST command in "monitor.c" which now displays the display
  list using mnemonics.
- Updated VMS command file.

Changes in 0.2.4
----------------

- Corrected mask in Atari800_GetByte() and Atari800_PutByte()
- In Atari800_PutByte(), only switch on cartridge type when an
  access is made to page $d5
- Screen generation using word access where possible.
- merged main.c with atari.c
- Fixed SVGALIB Escape and cursor keys.
- Emulated Floating Point Library which performs floating point
  arithmetic directly on your host computer - bypasses 6502 CPU
  emulation. Enabled by the -ffp option.

Changes in 0.2.3
----------------

- ADC and SBC functions are nolonger implemented as functions.
- 6502 PC, S, A, X, and Y register now handled using local
  variables. Copied to global variables on exit from cpu and
  restored on re-entry.
- Took advantage of a GCC feature: goto array[opcode]. Other compilers
  still use a switch statement.
- Amiga: DisplayScreen() tidied up
- Added DLIST command to monitor. This command shows the address of
  the display list (from hardware registers).
- Major recode of all Antic Graphics Modes. Now allows Horizontal and
  Vertial fine scrolling.
- Added an -interlace option to the SVGALIB version, giving a
  performance increase of about 10%. You would use this option to
  increase the speed of programs that must be run with a screen
  refresh rate of 1 (e.g. Burried Bucks)
- In the SVGALIB version, the F11 and F12 keys can be used to modify
  the vertical positioning of the emulated screen. F11 moves the screen
  down while F12 moves the screen up.
- Corrected a BUG causing River Raid to have corrupt screen display.

Changes in 0.2.2
----------------

- Made GetByte, GetWord and PutByte macros local to cpu.c
- Added some 386 inline asm() for some 6502 addressing modes
- Simplified Keyboard Handling
- Assembly routines for Amiga AGA screen handling

Changes in 0.2.1
----------------

- Created a new Makefile for Unix. The Amiga support is now in
  Makefile.amiga
- Sorry, but I renamed the ATARI800 environment variable to ATARI_LIBRARY
  which points to /usr/local/lib/atari by default.
- Control + Shift + Key combination for Linux SVGALIB implementation.
- SVGALIB version can be restarted after entering the monitor.
- HELP Key available in XL/XE mode
- Optional XVIEW (V3) Interface for X Window version. Allows disk changes
  using a file selector, controller configuration and access to performance
  variables.
- BREAK Key fixed
- PC Joysticks can be used with Linux (svgalib, x11 and xview) through the
  /dev/js0 and /dev/js1 devices. Second button activates the space bar
  which is very useful in Defender :-) Build with "make <system>" where
  <system> is one of:- linux-x11-joystick, linux-xview-joystick or
  linux-svgalib-joystick
- X11 Joystick emulation using keyboard re-implemented. Straight X11 can
  use either numeric keypad or cursor keys + space. XVIEW can only use
  cursor keys + space (Problem using keypad in xview!)
- Disk selector for Amiga version + controller configuration menu
- Started code to emulate SERIN and SEROUT registers. At the moment this
  is ongoing and does not work. New startup option -nopatch disables the
  SIO patch leaving the normal SIO routine in place.

Changes in 0.2.0
----------------

- Separated Playfield Scanlines from Player Missile Scanlines
- Corrected playfield colour errors in Antic modes 8 & 10
- Horizontal Fine Scrolling
- Playfield and Player/Missile Priorities
- Allow Emulator to run either as an Amiga Screen or Window
- Added Paddle support for Amiga

Changes in 0.1.9
----------------

- Corrected bug in IRQST and IRQEN
- Corrected minor bug in player missile collision detection
- Amiga version is now full screen + Menus
- Faster disk I/O
- Added ATARI800 environment variable. This allows the emulator to be
  run from different directories. If ATARI800 is unset it will still
  try to load the OS images from object/ below the current working
  directory.
- colours.h replaces colours.dat
- Added man page.
- New way of handling Joysticks, Triggers, Paddles and Console Keys
- Corrected handling of CHBASE which was causing K-RAZY ANTIKS to
  display garbage.
- Corrected handling of VCOUNT which was causing screen handling
  errors in Star Raiders (galactic map) and Henri (game screen).
- Added Sound API. A test sound implementation is available for
  the Linux SVGALIB version via /dev/sequencer - It's not very good
  and has only been used to test the API. It is enabled by starting
  the program with the -sound option. Listen to the title screens
  of Necromancer, K-Razy Antiks and Henri (these are the best
  I've heard).
- argc and argv are passed to the platform specific initialisation
  code - Atari_Initialise(). This allows platform specific options
  like -sound on the Linux SVGALIB version.
- Extra Amiga options -ocs -ecs and -aga. Currently the default is
  AGA. The -ocs and -ecs have been tested on an A1200 with the
  OCS and ECS emulation modes enabled. At the moment it is not
  guaranteed to work on real OCS or ECS equiped machines since it
  has only been tested under Workbench 3.0. Hopefully someone will
  provide some feedback.
- Another two Amiga options -grey and -colour. The -grey option
  produces a grey scale display on OCS, ECS and AGA machines. The
  -colour option produces a full colour display on AGA machines and
  up to 32 simultaneous colours on OCS and ECS machines.
- The DOUBLE_SIZE compilation flag for the X11 version has been
  replaced by a runtime options. The runtime options are -small,
  -large and -huge.

Changes in 0.1.8
----------------

- Allows direct use of GRAFP0, GRAFP1, GRAFP2, GRAFP3 and GRAFM without
  using DMA.
- -rom16 option to load standard 16K ROMs.
- -a option to load object/atariosa.rom
- -b [default] option to load object/atariosb.rom
- Simplified screen generation for host - Player missile graphics
  collision detection has been moved into 'atari_custom.c'
- Corrected read from PORTB (XL/XE emulation)
- GTIA support for *all* antic modes.
  i.e. GTIA can be enabled in graphics mode 0 (antic mode 2) just like
       a real 800. POKE 623 with 64, 128 or 192 to test.
- Amiga version can be compiled using either DICE C or GNU C - see Makefile

Changes in 0.1.7
----------------

- Issue cpu cycles during screen update (corrects VCOUNT problem)
    As a result DLI are not occuring on the correct mode line.
- Support for 256 bytes/sector ATR files
- Handle Insert, Delete and Tab keys properly
- Handle Shift + Control + A-Z properly (X11 only)
- Cartridge support tidied up (Thanks to Dave Bennett)

Changes in 0.1.6
----------------

- Correct Colours (Thanks to Chris Lam)
- Fetch correct number of screen bytes with horizontal scrolling enabled

Changes in 0.1.5
----------------

- CURSES text only mode (Support for various terminals)
- Display list jump instruction corrected.
- Fixed SIO module (It didn't update DSTATS)

Changes in 0.1.4
----------------

- Changed GetByte and PutByte to macros
- Added SVGALIB support for Linux which is much quicker than X11.
- Added support for OSS Super Cartridges (Thanks to Dave Bennett)
- -rom option to specify alternative cartridges
- -oss option to specify alternative OSS Super Cartridges

Changes in 0.1.3
----------------

- Compilation option for double size screen
- Trigger now initialises to not pressed
- Joystick now initialises to central
- Fifth Player support added
- Support for Paddle 0
- Preparation for changing GetByte and PutByte to macros.

Changes in 0.1.2
----------------

- Now include <stdlib.h>  in atari_custom.h

- Resets count to countdown as soon as it reaches zero. This was causing
  problems with the RESET Key - count went negative.

- Removed XImage structure. I am now updating only the pixels that have
  changed within a Pixmap. XCopyArea is used to move the Pixmap onto
  the Window. XCopyArea is not called if no pixels are changed. As a
  result I am trying a higher refresh rate.

- Correction for BASIC version - I left some X11 stuff in resulting in
  unresolved sybols.

- Remove unused status variable from atari_h_device.c

- Added some test Amiga Intuition Code - not usable (No Colour or Keyboard)
  It manages to get the 'READY' prompt up! Atari Basic Blue is one colour
  and everything else is the other. When keyboard support is added you
  will be able to use Atari Basic.

- Registers are now allocated variables within atari_custom.c. They are
  nolonger stored in main memory area.

Changes in 0.1.1 
----------------

- Outputs an error message when ROM images are not available.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

- Initial Release
