Up-to-date list of command line parameters and key mappings
===========================================================

Usage:
atari800 [options] [filenames]

where:
"filenames" are names of files supported by the emulator.
The following file types are currently supported:
- disk images: ATR, XFD, ATR.GZ/ATZ, XFD.GZ/XFZ, DCM, PRO, ATX
- programs: COM/EXE/XEX, BAS, LST
- cartridge images: CAR/CART, ROM (raw)
- tape images: CAS, raw bootable programs
- Atari800 state files: compressed and not compressed
Disk images are mounted in order, i.e. the first file is mounted
to the drive 1, next one to the drive 2, etc.

Cassette operation
==================
There is support for loading and saving from/to CAS tape images. It is also
possible to select raw files (DOS binaries, bootable programs, BASIC programs
etc.) as tape images, but only for loading. Upon attaching a tape image, the
emulator acts as if the tape recorder's "Play" button was permanently pressed,
so that a tape rolls automatically when an Atari program turns the tape motor
on.

Turning the SIO patch on speeds up the tape load and save operations. Note
that toggling the SIO patch during any tape operation will cause it to fail.

A tape image can be rewound to a specific part (block), to allow loading
from tape images which contain multiple programs one-after-another. After
rewinding the "Record" option is automatically turned off. Rewinding will
cause any tape operation being in progress to fail.

When a tape image is attached to Atari800, only loading from it is possible.
Before saving data on the tape, a user has to manually switch the "Record"
option to "yes", in the same way as one would manually press/release the
"Record" button on a physical tape recorder. Remember to disable the "Record"
option before loading from tape. Note that switching the "Record" option
on/off during any tape operation will cause it to fail and may cause random
data to be saved to a tape image.

With the SIO patch active, the emulator automatically recognises whether
a load or save operation is requested. and it is not necessary to touch the
"Record" option. This can lead to unwanted changes in a tape file. To avoid
the problem, a user can mark the attached cassette image as read-only to
disallow any write operations.

Saving to tape always casues the new blocks to be appended at the end of the
tape image, regardless of the tape's current position. It is not possible
to overwrite existing data on the tape.

A user can create a new empty CAS tape image with the "Make blank tape"
option. The user then provides the image's filename and its description
(stored in the CAS image's header; may be left empty). The created image is
automatically attached to Atari800 with the "Record" option turned on, which
allows to go straight to saving the data. Creating an image with the filename
pointing to an existing file will cause that file to be cleared.

Only standard blocks can be loaded or saved. Any copy protection that relies
on non-standard signals is not supported. Additionally, saving is only
supported with the standard speed of 600 baud.

Saving the emulator's state during a tape loading/saving is not supported. The
current tape operation is not stored in the savestate and it will not be
restored properly when that savestate is later loaded.

MIO and Black Box
==================
You need ROM images (not provided.)
Make a blank SCSI disk image (using dd for instance.)
Set MIO_SCSI_DISK or BB_SCSI_DISK to the disk image name.
Use 256 byte sectors for the Black Box.
Don't use SASI.
Use ALT-Backslash for the Black Box menu.
Don't use the OS patches, use -nopatchall.  The patches conflict with D1xx

1400XL/1450XLD
==================
You need ROM images (not provided.)
Don't use the OS patches, use -nopatchall.  The patches conflict with D1xx
The Self test can talk.
You can use the V: device to talk.
If you set the drives to empty, then a message appears on the 1450XLD screen
asking you to insert a disk.
If you press select when booting, the behavior of the 1450XLD disks is changed.
I believe it slows down for compability.
