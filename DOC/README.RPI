SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
====================
Atari800 version 4 requires a Pi2 or faster machine running Raspbian Stretch
or later.

VIDEO MODE
==========
Note: you need to setup correct video mode for PAL/NTSC machines (proper
video/audio sync and vsync).edit /boot/config.txt

for PAL version (50 Hz) you can supply this values:
720p mode:
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=19
1080p mode:
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=31

for NTSC version (60 Hz):
720p mode:
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=4
1080p mode:
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=16

See http://elinux.org/RPiconfig for more info.

These modes always improve synchronisation but the effect may not be
immediately obvious depending on what you are using the emulator for.
The benefit is most clearly seen on scrolling games like Boulderdash
where the whole background moves with no hint of flicker.

Best results are obtained with widescreen monitors.  A narrow monitor
such as 1280x1024 will distort the aspect ratio and there are no emulator
settings that can be adjusted to bring it back.

VIDEO GROUP
===========
If you are not logged on as the default user (pi), atari800 may crash
on startup and report: * failed to open vchiq instance.

To fix this, add yourself to the video group:

    sudo usermod -a -G video $(whoami)

and reboot.
