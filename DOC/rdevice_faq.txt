1. General Information

1.1 Q: What is an R: Device?
    A: The R: device is typically a handler for an RS-232 serial port.
       This serial port can be on an Atari 850, an MIO, Black Box or
       P:R:Connection from ICD.  Most handlers are the same with
       subtle differences.

1.2 Q: What is the Atari 850?
    A: The Atari 850 is a computer peripheral for the Atari 8-bit line
       of computers that was released in 1980.  
       It was called an "Interface module" that connected to the SIO port.  
       It provided 4 RS-232 serial ports:
         one was fully functional (R1:)
         and 3 that did not provide all the RS-232 signals (R2:-R4:). 
       It also provided one parallel port (P1:).
       
1.3 Q: What features of the 850 are supported by Atari800?
    A: Atari800 support several features of both the 850 hardware and the
       R: handler.  There are two modes of operation for the R: device 
       emulation: network sockets or serial port.  I will talk more about
       this below, but you can either use the host serial ports 
       (/dev/ttyS* under Linux) or network sockets (ports 9000-9003).
 
       XIO calls (The following are the BASIC examples):
       -------------------------------------------------

       In each of the XIO calls below, 'channel' specifies the IOCB or 
       channel number (1-7) and "Rn" specifies the RS-232-C port, 
       where n = {1-4}.

                            - XIO 32 - 
       
       XIO 32, #channel, Aux1, Aux2, "Rn:"

       (Not Implemented)

                            - XIO 34 - 
       
       XIO 34, #channel, Aux1, Aux2, "Rn:"

         Aux1 bits do the following:
         
         Aux1[7] = DTR control enable (active high)
         Aux1[6] = Force DTR value
         Aux1[5] = RTS control enable (active high)
         Aux1[4] = Force RTS value
         Aux1[3] = not used
         Aux1[2] = not used
         Aux1[1] = XMT control enable (active high)
         Aux1[0] = Force XMT to SPACE (0) or MARK (1) * Not implemented
       
         To force DTR off: Aux1 = 128
         To force DTR on:  Aux1 = 192
       
         Aux2 is unused.

       XIO 34 is really only used if using the serial port on the host,
       if you are using network sockets, then changing DTR is the only
       operation that you may perform.  Turning DTR off, in this case, 
       will disconnect.
       
                            - XIO 36 - 
       
       XIO 36, #channel, Aux1, Aux2, "Rn:"
       
         Aux1 select the Baud rate, the Word size and the stop bits.
         Add the values listed below to obtain the BASIC number.

         Aux1[3:0] = Baud rate where:
                     0 = 300 bps
                     1 = 57600 bps (was 45.5 bps in 850 spec)
                     2 = 50 bps 
                     3 = 115200 bps (was 56.875 bps in 850 spec)
                     4 = 75 bps
                     5 = 110 bps
                     6 = 134.5 bps
                     7 = 150 bps
                     8 = 300 bps
                     9 = 600 bps
                    10 = 1200 bps
                    11 = 1800 bps
                    12 = 2400 bps
                    13 = 4800 bps
                    14 = 9600 bps 
                    15 = 19200 bps

         Aux1[5:4] = Word size where:
                     0 = 8 bits
                     1 = 7 bits
                     2 = 6 bits
                     3 = 5 bits

         Aux1[6] = Select 230400 bps (feature added to Atari800)             

         Aux1[7] = Stop bits
                   0 = 1 stop bit
                   1 = 2 stop bits

         Aux2 specifies whether or not the Interface Module should check
         Data Set Ready (DSR), Clear to Send (CTS) and/or Carrier Detect (CD).
         This function is currently not supported.
    
                            - XIO 38 - 
       
       XIO 38, #channel, Aux1, Aux2, "Rn:"

         Aux1 Specifies te translation mode, input/output parity modes and
         the append Line Feed option.
        
         Aux1[1:0] = Output Parity (* Not Implemented)
                     0 = Do not change parity bit
                     1 = Set output parity odd
                     2 = Set output parity even
                     3 = Set output parity bit to 1

         Aux1[3:2] = Input Parity
                     0 = Ignore and do not change Parity bit (NO PARITY)
                     1 = Set Parity to ODD
                     2 = Set Parity to EVEN
                     3 = Do not use Parity (NO PARITY)

         Aux1[4] = Heavy Translation * Not Implemented
                   0 = Light Translation
                   1 = Heavy Translation

         Aux1[5] = Translation
                   0 = Translation ON
                   1 = Translation off

         Aux1[6] = Line Feeds
                   0 = Do not append LF
                   1 = Append LF after Carriage Return

         Aux1[7] = Not Used          

         Aux2 is the numeric representation of the "won't translate" character
         for heavy translation.  (Not currently supported.)

                            - XIO 40 - 
       
       XIO 40, #channel, Aux1, Aux2, "Rn:"
       
         XIO 40 starts concurrent I/O Mode.

         Both Aux1 and Aux2 are used to specify an output buffer, but using
         the specified input buffer is not currently supported.  The default
         256 byte internal buffer is use when both Aux1 and Aux2 = 0.  

         However, since using a different buffer is not supported, the
         setting Aux1 or Aux2 to any value will not affect how this works.

       Other BASIC commands:
       ---------------------
       OPEN #Channel, Aux1, Aux2, "Rn:"

         Aux1 specifies the direction of the port.
           Aux1[7:4] = NOT USED.
           Aux1[3] = Specifies Output when high.
           Aux1[2] = Specifies Input when high.
           Aux1[1] = NOT USED.
           Aux1[0] = Specifies Concurrent I/O mode.
        
         Aux2 is not used.

       CLOSE #Channel
         
         Closes the Serial port or the network connection.

       GET, INPUT, PUT and PRINT - Use as normal

       STATUS #Channel, AVAR 
         
         The STATUS command will update the memory locations 746-749.  
         Please read the meaning of these locations below.

         AVAR is a variable that receives the status returned for the STATUS
         call itself.  This number will be the same as the ERROR code.
   
       Atari Memory Address Locations:
       -------------------------------

       The following locations will be updated after a STATUS call (after
       the STATUS function/routine runs).

       0x2ea (746) - Error flags (* Not Implemented)
                     bit[7] = Received Data Framing Error
                     bit[6] = Received Data Byte Overrun Error
                     bit[5] = Received Data Parity Error
                     bit[4] = Received Data Buffer Overflow error
                     bit[3] = Illegal Option Combination Attempted
                     bit[2] = External Device Not Fully Ready Flag
                     bit[1] = Error On Block Data Transfer Out
                     bit[0] = Error On Command To Interface Module

       0x2eb (747) - Concurrent I/O Mode:
                     Number of Characters in Input buffer (Low Byte)
                     
                     Non-Concurrent I/O Mode: (* Not Implemented)
                     bit[7] = Data Set Ready (DSR) status during current 
                              STATUS command.  0=DSR is low; 1=DSR is hi.
                     bit[6] = DSR status during last STATUS command.
                     bit[5] = Clear to Send (CTS) status during current
                              STATUS command. 0=CTS is low; 1=CTS is hi.
                     bit[4] = CTS status during last STATUS command.
                     bit[3] = CARRIER DETECT (CD) status during current 
                              STATUS command. 0=CD is low; 1=CD is high.
                     bit[2] = CD status during last STATUS command.
                     bit[1] = NOT USED.
                     bit[0] = Data Receive (RCV) current status.
                              1 = MARK (1)
                              0 = SPACE (0)

       0x2ec (748) - Concurrent I/O Mode:
                     Number of Characters in Input buffer (High Byte)
                     This is always zero in Atari800 since the input
                     buffer is only 256 bytes.

                     Non-Concurrent I/O Mode:
                     Always zero.

       0x2ed (749) - Concurrent I/O Mode:
                     Number of Character in Output Buffer.
                     This is always zero in Atari800 since we always
                     output the character, so a write of more than
                     one character will not work.

                     Non-Concurrent I/O Mode:
                     Always Zero.

1.4 Q: What features of the 850 are not currently supported by Atari800?
    A: 

    1. Cannot set RTS or XMT in XIO 34.
    2. Cannot select 45.5 bps or 56.875 bps in XIO 36.
    3. Cannot monitor DSR, CTS or CD in XIO 36.
    4. Heavy ASCII/ATASCII translation.
    5. Early force of short I/O block (XIO 32).  This forces the output
       buffer to be sent, but it is not currently implement as we now
       always send after a write.
    6. Cannot set output parity with XIO 38.  The Output parity is set the
       same as the input parity.
    7. Using a different input buffer, as specified by XIO 40 is not supported.
       I am not sure anyone ever used this anyway...
    8. Not all functions return an error code if something fails.
       Most of the functions should return an error to regY.  
    9. Error bits at location 746 are not implemented.   
   10. Although you can access each serial port or talk to the network to 
       a different socket, you cannot have more than one R: device
       open at a time.  For example, you cannot open R1: and R2: and expect
       things to behave sanely.  The reason for this is that currently
       there is only one buffer for ALL serial ports.
   11. Error reporting to address 747 during non-concurrent mode has 
       not been implemented.  In fact non-concurrent mode has not been
       tested!  I invite you to test it and let me know!!!


1.5 Q: Is there a version of the 850 Operator's Manual On-line?
    A: I am currently working on scanning the original Document.  See below
       in the links section.

1.6 Q: Do you have some example code?
    A: Yes.  Below are several BASIC programs taken from the 850 Operator's
       Manual.  Also included is a C program written by Christian Groessler
       using the rs232 library for cc65 (www.cc65.org).

1.7 Q: What Atari programs use the R: device?
    A: 
       Terminal programs: Bobterm, Ice-T, etc.
       BBS programs:  Express, Carina, etc.
       Some Games:  I know I saw a Modem Chess game back in the day.
                    I will have to find the ATR image of this.


1.8 Q: How does the Serial Port Version work?
    A: Basically, in this mode, when you open R1: under Atari800, you will
       open the first serial port on the host computer.  Under Linux, this 
       will be /dev/ttyS0. Opening R2: will open /dev/ttyS1 and so on.
       When you control the baud rate, parity, stop bits (with XIO 36), you
       will control the host serial port.  The same will all the other 
       configuration options, this will set those options on the host 
       serial port.  This mode can be used to connect to a real MODEM, or
       to use a null-modem cable to connect to you Linux host.  The 
       null-modem could be used to run SLIP(Linux) and Contiki on Atari800.

       The R: device emulation will take care of adding Line Feeds and 
       Light ASCII translation.
      
1.9 Q: How does the Network Sockets version work?
    A: This mode works similarly to the Serial Port Version, except that
       instead of connecting to the host serial ports you will connect
       to a network socket.  All configuration such as baud rate, parity
       et cetera will be ignored, since these mean nothing in this mode.

       Opening an R: device will open a network socket and allow other users
       to "telnet" into Atari800.  For example, if you open R1:, port 9000
       will accept connections from other hosts (or the local host). R2: will
       accept connections on 9001, and so on.  Only one of these can 
       currently be opened at one time.  (I may add support for
       multiple R: devices later.)  Allow others to connect to your 
       emulated Atari can be used to run an emulated BBS or to potentially
       run a web server from Atari800.

       Also included with the Network Sockets version of the R: Device
       emulation is a somewhat handicapped Modem emulation.  There are
       only two commands that are implemented:

       ATDL - Translates carrage returns into line feeds. 
              This may not be needed if the "add line feeds" in XIO 38 
              is used.  But I found that it is not always used by terminal
              programs, and thus some telnet and ftp servers expect
              a line feed, causing you to not be able to do anything
              once connected.

              Typing 'ATDL' in a terminal program such as Bobterm or Ice-T
              will toggle CR translation on/off.
       
       ATDI <address name|ip address> <port #>

              This command allows you to "dial" out to an external host.
              For example you can connect to my BBS by typing the following:
              'ATDI jybolac.homelinux.com 800'
        
              This connects Atari800 to the external host 
              'jybolac.homelinux.com' at port 800.
      
       These commands were chosen to somewhat look like modem 'AT' commands.

       The R: device emulation will take care of adding Line Feeds and 
       Light ASCII translation, same as in the Serial Port Version.
       

1.10 Q: Who wrote the R: Device Emulation?
     A: Tom Hunt wrote the original network sockets version.  I, Chris Martin,
        updated that code, added the simple modem emulation and added code
        to access the serial ports on the host computer via the R: device.  I
        also added ASCII/ATASCII translation.

1.11 Q: Do you have any URLs for more information?
     A: Sure!

    I am working on scanning and placing the Atari 850 Operator's Manual
    online here:
    http://jybolac.virtualave.net/atari/850man/

    The MIO documentation has some great info that still applies to
    the 850:
