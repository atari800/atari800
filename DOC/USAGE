Up-to-date list of command line parameters and key mappings
===========================================================

Usage:
atari800 [options] [filenames]

where:
"filenames" are names of files supported by the emulator.
The following file types are currently supported:
- disk images: ATR, XFD, ATR.GZ/ATZ, XFD.GZ/XFZ, DCM
- programs: COM/EXE/XEX, BAS, LST
- cartridge images: CAR/CART, ROM (raw)
- tape images: CAS, raw bootable programs
- Atari800 state files: compressed and not compressed
Disk images are mounted in order, i.e. the first file is mounted
to the drive 1, next one to the drive 2, etc.

Cassette operation
==================

As there is no possibility to create a new tape from the UI yet, create a file
of zero size (e.g. with 'touch' command or a text editor) and Select that
as tape if you want to save to tape.
Appending to existing tapes is not allowed. You have to re-insert (select
again in the tape dialog) a just saved tape when you want to load from it
in order to rewind it.

MIO and Black Box
==================
You need ROM images (not provided.)
Make a blank SCSI disk image (using dd for instance.)
Set MIO_SCSI_DISK or BB_SCSI_DISK to the disk image name.
Use 256 byte sectors for the Black Box.
Don't use SASI.
Use ALT-Backslash for the Black Box menu.
Don't use the OS patches, use -nopatchall.  The patches conflict with D1xx

1400XL/1450XLD
==================
You need ROM images (not provided.)
Don't use the OS patches, use -nopatchall.  The patches conflict with D1xx
The Self test can talk.
You can use the V: device to talk.
If you set the drives to empty, then a message appears on the 1450XLD screen
asking you to insert a disk.
If you press select when booting, the behavior of the 1450XLD disks is changed.
I believe it slows down for compability.

Paddles, Atari touch tablet, Koala pad, light pen, light gun,
ST/Amiga mouse, Atari trak-ball, joystick and Atari 5200 analog
controller are emulated using mouse on ports that support it.
See the options above for how to enable mouse.


Amiga keyboard, joystick and other controllers
----------------------------------------------

Please look into the supplied Atari800.guide.


BASIC keyboard, joystick and other controllers
----------------------------------------------

No function keys or Alt+letter shortcuts.
Use Ctrl+C to enter the monitor.
Controllers not supported in this version.


Curses keyboard, joystick and other controllers
-----------------------------------------------

F10 (Save screenshot) does not work in the default CURSES_BASIC build.
Shift+F5 and Shift+F10 don't work at all.
Avoid Ctrl + C, H, J, M, Q, S and Z. The remaining control characters
can be typed. Control characters are displayed on the screen
with the associated upper case character in bold.
Controllers not supported in this version.


DOS VGA keyboard, joystick and other controllers
------------------------------------------------

F7         Switch between Emulated joysticks mode and Normal keyboard
`          Atari/Inverse key

Joysticks can be either real one connected to game port, or old 8-bit
digital CX-40 joysticks connected to parallel port or keyboard joysticks
(try out JOYCFG.EXE).


Falcon keyboard, joystick and other controllers
-----------------------------------------------

Help       Help key (XL/XE)

Joystick 0 is operated by the numeric keypad (make sure that the numeric
keypad has been enabled).

        7 8 9
         \|/
        4 5 6
         /|\
        1 2 3

        And 0 is the fire key.

Mouse not supported in this version.


SDL keyboard, joystick and other controllers
--------------------------------------------
`          Atari/Inverse key
LSUPER     Atari/Inverse key (unusable under Windows)
RSUPER     CapsToggle (+Shift = CapsLock)

LAlt+F     Switch fullscreen (probably doesn't work in Windows)
LAlt+G     Switch WIDTH_MODE (so you can set 320x240)
LAlt+B     Switch BLACK-AND-WHITE
LAlt+J     Swap _keyboard_emulated_ joysticks
LAlt+E     Switch bpp (for debug only, will be removed soon)
LAlt+M     Grab mouse (prevents mouse pointer from leaving the window)

These keys work with the NTSC composite video emualtion (-ntscemu):
(This interface should be considered experimental and is subject to change)
LAlt+1     Decrease NTSC sharpness 
LAlt+2     Increase NTSC sharpness 
LAlt+3     Decrease NTSC saturation (like TV Colour control)
LAlt+4     Increase NTSC saturation
LAlt+5     Decrease NTSC brightness (also called black level)
LAlt+6     Increase NTSC brightness
LAlt+7     Decrease NTSC contrast (also called white level) 
LAlt+8     Increase NTSC contrast
LAlt+9     Decrease NTSC burst phase (use this to change artifacting colours) 
LAlt+0     Increase NTSC burst phase
LAlt+-     Decrease NTSC Gaussian factor (ghosting, sharpness, artif colours)
LAlt+=     Increase NTSC Gaussian factor (ghosting, sharpness, artif colours)
LAlt+[     Decrease scanlines percentage (NTSC mode only)
LAlt+]     Increase scanlines percentage (NTSC mode only)
LAlt+;     Decrease NTSC hue (like TV Tint control)
LAlt+'     Increase NTSC hue (like TV Tint control)
LAlt+Ins   Decrease NTSC saturation ramp(reduce saturation for bright colours) 
LAlt+Ins   Increase NTSC saturation ramp(reduce saturation for bright colours) 

LAlt+Shift+X Enable/disable XEP80 screen (use with -xep80)


Apart from standard joysticks (handled by the SDL) two keyboard joysticks
are supported.

Keyboard joystick 0 is operated by the numeric keypad.

        7 8 9
         \|/
        4 5 6
         /|\
        1 2 3

        And left control is the fire key.

Keyboard joystick 1 is by default mapped on the following keys:

        q w e
         \|/
        a s d
         /|\
        z x c

        And Tab is the fire key.

Keyboard joystick emulation can be enabled/disabled in the Controller Config.
By default, joy 0 is enabled and joy 1 is disabled (to not steal normal
qweadzxc keys in the emulator).

To redefine keys for joystick emulation edit the Atari800 config file and
modify the SDL_JOY_* options (see FAQ). You can also edit the default values
in the atari_sdl.c, then recompile Atari800. In source you can also turn
off sound or change defaults (FULLSCREEN, BW, SWAP_JOYSTICKS, WIDTH_MODE).


X11 keyboard, joystick and other controllers
--------------------------------------------

Alt        Atari/Inverse key (either Alt key will work)

Joystick 0 is operated by the mouse position relative to the center of the
screen. The mouse button acts as the trigger. On Linux, standard joysticks
are also supported.
