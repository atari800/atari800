This file describes types of cartridge images supported by the Atari800
emulator.

There are:
- raw images - files that contain only dump of cartridge memory
- CART files - images with additional 16-byte header, which contains type
  of the cartridge

For raw images you usually have to select the cartridge type each time
you insert an image. To make it easier, you only select from types of same
image size. If there's only one supported type that matches file's length
(like there's for 4 KB cartridges), that type is selected automatically.

The advantage of using CART files is that you don't have to select
the cartridge type, because it is stored inside the file.

The CART format has been introduced in Atari800 0.8.0, when there were
only 4 supported cartridge types. The format has not changed, only new types
have been added.

The format is:
 first 4 bytes containing 'C' 'A' 'R' 'T'.
 next 4 bytes containing cartridge type in MSB format (see the table below).
 next 4 bytes containing cartridge checksum in MSB format (ROM only).
 next 4 bytes are currently unused (zero).
 followed immediately with the ROM data: 4, 8, 16, 32, 40, 64, 128, 256, 512
 or 1024 kilobytes.

The recommended file name extension for CART files is CAR.

+----+-----------+------+---------------------------------------------------+

Id is the cartridge type code stored in the CART file.

Machine indicates if the cartridge is for Atari 8-bit Home Computers
(400/800 and XL/XE) or the Atari 5200 Game System.

Size is length of image in kilobytes.

Below are descriptions of all types. For bank-switched cartridges bank A
stands for the first bank in the image, bank B is the second, etc.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 1: Standard 8 KB cartridge                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 8 KB cartridge, that occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000
 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 2: Standard 16 KB cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 16 KB cartridge, that occupies 16 KB of address space between
 $8000 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 3: OSS '034M' 16 KB cartridge                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 There are two types of OSS cartridges. Both are 16 KB and occupy 8 KB
 of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided
 into 4 banks, 4 KB each. One bank ('main') is always mapped to $B000-$BFFF.
 The other 3 banks are mapped to $A000-$AFFF. The current bank is selected
 by accessing a byte in $D500-$D5FF. Only 4 lowest bits of address are
 significant.

 The '034M' scheme is the more complicated one.
 The main bank is D. An access to:
 $D5x0 or $D5x1 selects bank A.
 $D5x3 or $D5x7 selects bank B.
 $D5x4 or $D5x5 selects bank C.
 $D5x2 or $D5x6 is not useful. It disables ROM (there're $FF bytes
 in $A000-$AFFF).
 $D5x8-$D5xF disables whole cartridge (enables computer's memory in address
 space between $A000 and $BFFF).

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 4: Standard 32 KB 5200 cartridge                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 32 KB cartridge for Atari 5200, that occupies 32 KB of address
 space between $4000 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 5: DB 32 KB cartridge                                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 A 32 KB bank-switched cartridge. There are 4 banks. Bank D is mapped to
 $A000-$BFFF. Bank in $8000-$9FFF is selected by an access to $D500-$D5FF.
 Two lowest bits of address select bank A, B, C or D.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 6: Two chip 16 KB 5200 cartridge                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 In Atari 5200 there's 32 KB of address space reserved for the cartridge
 ($4000-$BFFF). A two chip 16 KB cartridge is mapped that way:
 - First 8 KB are mapped into lower 16 KB. Since an address line is not
   connected, $4000-$5FFF and $6000-$7FFF contain same data, which is first
   half of the cartridge image.
 - Similarly, second 8 KB are mapped into upper 16 KB.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 7: Bounty Bob Strikes Back 40 KB 5200 cartridge                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge with "Bounty Bob Strikes Back" game uses very strange
 bank switching method:
 - Four 4 KB banks (A,B,C,D) are mapped into $4000-$4FFF. An access to $4FF6
   selects bank A, $4FF7 - bank B, $4FF8 - bank C, $4FF9 - bank D.
 - Four 4 KB banks (E,F,G,H) are mapped into $5000-$5FFF. An access to $5FF6
   selects bank E, $5FF7 - bank F, $5FF8 - bank G, $5FF9 - bank H.
 - The remaining 8 KB is mapped to upper 16 KB of cartridge address space
   in Atari 5200. That is, $8000-$9FFF and $A000-$BFFF contain same data.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 8: 64 KB Williams cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D500 selects
 bank A, $D501 - bank B, etc. An access to $D508-$D50F disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 9: Express 64 KB cartridge                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D577 selects
 bank A, $D576 - bank B, etc. An access to $D578-$D57F disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 10: Diamond 64 KB cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D5D7 selects
 bank A, $D5D6 - bank B, etc. An access to $D5D8-$D5DF disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 11: SpartaDOS X 64 KB cartridge                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D5E7 selects
 bank A, $D5E6 - bank B, etc. An access to $D5E8-$D5EF disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 12: XEGS 32 KB cartridge                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 4 banks, 8 KB each.

 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 13: XEGS 64 KB cartridge                                             |

| Type 14: XEGS 128 KB cartridge                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 16 banks, 8 KB each.

 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 15: OSS 'M091' 16 KB cartridge                                       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This is the simpler one of OSS schemes. It uses only A0 and A3 address
 lines:
 A3=0, A0=0 - $A000-$AFFF: bank B, $B000-$BFFF: bank A
 A3=0, A0=1 - $A000-$AFFF: bank D, $B000-$BFFF: bank A
 A3=1, A0=0 - disable cartridge
 A3=1, A0=1 - $A000-$AFFF: bank C, $B000-$BFFF: bank A

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge with "Bounty Bob Strikes Back" game uses very strange
 bank switching method:
 - Four 4 KB banks (A,B,C,D) are mapped into $8000-$8FFF. An access to $8FF6
   selects bank A, $8FF7 - bank B, $8FF8 - bank C, $8FF9 - bank D.
