This file describes types of cartridge images supported by the Atari800
emulator.

There are:
- raw images - files that contain only dump of cartridge memory
- CART files - images with additional 16-byte header, which contains type
  of the cartridge

For raw images you usually have to select the cartridge type each time
you insert an image. To make it easier, you only select from types of same
image size. If there's only one supported type that matches file's length
(like there's for 4 KB cartridges), that type is selected automatically.

The advantage of using CART files is that you don't have to select
the cartridge type, because it is stored inside the file.

The CART format has been introduced in Atari800 0.8.0, when there were
only 4 supported cartridge types. The format has not changed, only new types
have been added.

The format is:
 first 4 bytes containing 'C' 'A' 'R' 'T'.
 next 4 bytes containing cartridge type in MSB format (see the table below).
 next 4 bytes containing cartridge checksum in MSB format (ROM only).
 next 4 bytes are currently unused (zero).
 followed immediately with the ROM data: 4, 8, 16, 32, 40, 64, 128, 256, 512
 or 1024 kilobytes.

The recommended file name extension for CART files is CAR.

Id is the cartridge type code stored in the CART file.

Machine indicates if the cartridge is for Atari 8-bit Home Computers
(400/800 and XL/XE) or the Atari 5200 Game System.

Size is length of image in kilobytes.

Below are descriptions of all types. For bank-switched cartridges banks
are numbered in the order they appear in the image file, starting with 0.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 1: Standard 8 KB cartridge                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 8 KB cartridge, that occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000
 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 2: Standard 16 KB cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 16 KB cartridge, that occupies 16 KB of address space between
 $8000 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 3: OSS '034M' 16 KB cartridge                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 There are two types of OSS cartridges. Both are 16 KB and occupy 8 KB
 of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided
 into 4 banks, 4 KB each. One bank ('main') is always mapped to $B000-$BFFF.
 The other 3 banks are mapped to $A000-$AFFF. The current bank is selected
 by accessing a byte in $D500-$D5FF. Only 4 lowest bits of address are
 significant.

 The '034M' scheme is the more complicated one.
 The main bank is 3. An access to:
 $D5x0 selects bank 0.
 $D5x1 is not useful - it selects banks 0 and 2 (the bytes are binary AND of
 the corresponding bytes from banks 0 and 1).
 $D5x3 or $D5x7 selects bank 2.
 $D5x4 selects bank 1.
 $D5x5 is not useful - it selects banks 1 and 2 (the bytes are binary AND of
 the corresponding bytes from banks 1 and 2).
 $D5x2 or $D5x6 is not useful. It disables ROM (there are $FF bytes
 in $A000-$AFFF).
 $D5x8-$D5xF disables whole cartridge (enables computer's memory in address
 space between $A000 and $BFFF).

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 4: Standard 32 KB 5200 cartridge                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Standard 32 KB cartridge for Atari 5200, that occupies 32 KB of address
 space between $4000 and $BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 5: DB 32 KB cartridge                                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 A 32 KB bank-switched cartridge. There are 4 banks. Bank 3 is mapped to
 $A000-$BFFF. Bank in $8000-$9FFF is selected by an access to $D500-$D5FF.
 Two lowest bits of address select bank 0, 1, 2 or 3.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 6: Two chip 16 KB 5200 cartridge                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 In Atari 5200 there's 32 KB of address space reserved for the cartridge
 ($4000-$BFFF). A two chip 16 KB cartridge is mapped that way:
 - First 8 KB are mapped into lower 16 KB. Since an address line is not
   connected, $4000-$5FFF and $6000-$7FFF contain same data, which is first
   half of the cartridge image.
 - Similarly, second 8 KB are mapped into upper 16 KB.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 7: Bounty Bob Strikes Back 40 KB 5200 cartridge                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge with "Bounty Bob Strikes Back" game uses very strange
 bank switching method:
 - Four 4 KB banks (0,1,2,3) are mapped into $4000-$4FFF. An access to $4FF6
   selects bank 0, $4FF7 - bank 1, $4FF8 - bank 2, $4FF9 - bank 3.
 - Four 4 KB banks (4,5,6,7) are mapped into $5000-$5FFF. An access to $5FF6
   selects bank 4, $5FF7 - bank 5, $5FF8 - bank 6, $5FF9 - bank 7.
 - The remaining 8 KB is mapped to upper 16 KB of cartridge address space
   in Atari 5200. That is, $8000-$9FFF and $A000-$BFFF contain same data.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 8: 64 KB Williams cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D500 selects
 bank 0, $D501 - bank 1, etc. An access to $D508-$D50F disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 9: Express 64 KB cartridge                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D577 selects
 bank 0, $D576 - bank 1, etc. An access to $D578-$D57F disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 10: Diamond 64 KB cartridge                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. An access to $D5D7 selects
 bank 0, $D5D6 - bank 1, etc. An access to $D5D8-$D5DF disables
 the cartridge.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 11: SpartaDOS X 64 KB cartridge                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The cartridge has 8 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. It also contains an
 additional cartridge slot which allows to plug a second cartridge in.
 An access to $D5E7 selects bank 0, $D5E6 - bank 1, etc. down to $D5E0. An
 access to $D5E8-$D5EB disables the SDX cartridge and enables the second
 cartridge. An access to $D5EC-$D5EF disables both cartriges.
 Accesses to all addresses on page D5 always reaches the second cartridge,
 even if it is disabled by SpartaDOS or if the SpartaDOS cartridge itself is
 enabled.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 12: XEGS 32 KB cartridge                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 4 banks, 8 KB each.

 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 13: XEGS 64 KB cartridge                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 14: XEGS 128 KB cartridge                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 16 banks, 8 KB each.

 a byte written to $D500-$D5FF select the bank mapped to $8000-$BFFF.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type 15: OSS 'M091' 16 KB cartridge                                       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This is the simpler one of OSS schemes. It uses only A0 and A3 address
 lines:
 A3=0, A0=0 - $A000-$AFFF: bank 1, $B000-$BFFF: bank 0
 A3=0, A0=1 - $A000-$AFFF: bank 3, $B000-$BFFF: bank 0
 A3=1, A0=0 - disable cartridge

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This bank-switched cartridge occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000
 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 16 banks, 8 KB each.
 If a byte written to $D500-$D5FF has highest bit set, the cartridge is
 disabled. Otherwise four lowest bits select the bank mapped to $A000-$BFFF.

 The cartridge has 16 banks mapped to $A000-$BFFF. It also contains an
 additional cartridge slot which allows to plug a second cartridge in. First
 8 banks are selected by an access to $D5F7-$D5F0, the other 8 banks by an
 access to $D5E7-$D5E0. An access to $D5E8-$D5EB or $D5F8-$D5FB disables the
 SDX cartridge and enables the second cartridge. An access to $D5EC-$D5EF or
 $D5FC-$D5FF disables both cartriges.
 Accesses to all addresses on page D5 always reaches the second cartridge,
 even if it is disabled by SpartaDOS or if the SpartaDOS cartridge itself is
 enabled.
